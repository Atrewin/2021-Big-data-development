"BLU Studio 5.0 S D570I Unlocked Dual Sim Phone with Quad-Core 1.2GHz Processor, Android 4.1 JB, 5.0-inch IPS High Resolution Display, and 8MP Camera (Black)",CT-Miami LLC,,3,"When I first considered buying this phone, I was skeptical.It seemed too good to be true, especially for the price.I read the reviews, and decided to take a chance.I am happy to say, I was not disappointed.First, I will start by listing the cons. Everyone wants to know them.CONSSCREEN: The phone's screen's pixels are inferior to many brands such as Apple or Samsung.The screen's resolution is 540 x 960, and the dpi is only 240.SYSTEM STORAGE: The space of this phone is horrifying, only 1.4gb of internal storage.RAM: 1gb (more like an actual 800mb) of RAM can get tedious, but I recommend using CleanMaster to periodically erase cache files and clear up RAM space. Or you can always do ""killall"" in options.Front Camera: The photo's taken by it are very dark, and for unknown reasons at that. Also, the front camera, in nice terms, sucks. It is not very good compared to the back camera, but supposedly still takes HD streaming for facetime. Supposedly. If anyone can comment about this, please do, as I do not facetime.LAG: Sometimes, and I am not sure why this happens, the phone lags. Whether it be in music or in mid-sentence typing, or playing a game, the phone freezes up, but then very quickly goes back to normal. I think that it is because of the CPU % that spikes up for unknown reasons. Keep in mind that CPU and RAM are two very different things. This gets aggravating at times, espeically when I listen to music, as the sound gets distorted for around a second, but then goes back to normal. It could happen in a short timespan, multiple times, though, as a warning to those who avidly listen to music, or use applications like I do.EDIT: I FOUND THAT THIS PHONE CAN ONLY CAPTURE EDGE. This is a great disappointment. T-TNow. For the Pros!PROSQUAD-CORE PROCESSOR: Like I mentioned before, there is a bit of system lag, but almost 95% of the time, the phone is VERY fast and good. It may have sounded like I pulled the trigger on this product when I was saying the cons, but mind you, I AM the devil's advocate.SCREEN: I love the screen size. 5 inches. It is big. It is clear. It is good. Even though I said that the pixels were inferior to bigger name brands, please keep in mind that this phone is only around $170. It is more clear than one would think.SIZE: Personally, I love the size. The whole phone is around maybe 6 inches length, from top to bottom. It is also very slim and sleek, just like the description. They weren't lying about that.BATTERY: It is not the best battery, but it certainly beats some trash out there I have seen. Supposedly, it lasts for 24 hours, but in extensive use of this phone, it lasts around 15 hours with continuous use. (Cellular reception, Wi-fi, some applications, e.x. Facebook, Messenger, Snapchat, and YouTube.)EVERYTHING ELSE: This phone is very good for the price. Even though there are more cons than the pros, it is because I can't think of many pros. This just means that everything else works like it is supposed to, and maybe even better. I will say that the speed on this thing rivals Samsung S4's, at certain times, and for a fraction of the price.OVERALL, this phone is worth it. If you want to get a new smartphone, and do not have the money to invest on an $800 new gadget, please consider buying this. You will (probably) not regret it.Many thanks for reading this! :)",0.0,4

This phone may not be for everyone due to its size but for certain occupations and individuals with large hands it's heaven-sent!UPDATE:well, since this replaced an HTC One m7 with no external sd card support, I didn't realize Google decided to cripple being able to use external sd cards for WRITING data since their Kit Kat build. Luckily, this is easily alleviated by rooting the phone and installing xposed framework. Theres also a could apps on the play store that will allow RW on external sd card slot as well IF you install root access. I am friggin thrilled with this phone so far.

It is my first BLU device and I admit I was skeptical to switch from years of loyalty to Samsung. It turned out to be a rewarding decision. The setup is very user friendly and the speed is remarkable. In fact the only thing that slightly did dissapointed me was the camera. I'm using the phone currently in Germany without any setbacks. Not sure if I would pay twice as much for it as some have suggested. However, I do think it does hold the value far above and makes me look at BLU with eyes of an returning customer.",1.0,3

We were sold a phone with a BLOCKED SERIAL NUMBER, meaning that it can never be used. Period. The previous owner didnt pay their bill and we got sold the end product. A phone with a permanently blocked SERIAL NUMBER. I was told by TMOBILE, when I called to find out how to unlock it, that even if I did it could never be used because the SERIAL NUMBER is associated with an unpaid account, So I spent 200.00+ on a paper weight. Fulfilled by Amazon. So they dropped the ball a bit on checking it to see if it was even usable. Customer Service told me it was a mistake. YEAH. A mistake that cost me 6.00-7.00 for the SIM card and 46.90 for a 30 day phone card through Straight Talk, where we were trying to set it up. Before you go telling me that I should have checked it first, I shouldn't HAVE TO!! I should be able to reasonably expect that the phone was valid.

So, all those suspicious glowing reviews may not be happy after 6 months.Ok, so after all that I return it and, using my tracking number, I see that they received it. Then I waited for a refund, but it never came. I contact them and they said that I have to give them a tracking number in order to get a refund. That was not a part of the return policy. At that point I couldn't find my tracking number so I had to beg my post office for copy. Another waste of 2 hours.The worst part is that this phone isn't even a great deal. I got a new brand model from Boost mobile for the same price. If you want one on the Verizon network, then go with a Groupon deal - again, for the same price. Don't risk a refurbished unless there is a steep discount.Lastly, if you want a free phone, just buy one from these guys and return an empty box.

More than once I had to take it out of my pocket because It was burning my leg (I'm not exaggerating), Maps + Spotify? It's a nice way to kill your brand new phone.

Then I spent 45 minutes on the phone (on a different line) with my phone provider's customer service rep, going through his list, which was essentially the same as all the things I had just tried, plus factory resetting it and attempting to set it up from scratch. Still no luck. He concluded it was probably defective.I ordered a second unit, which arrived in generic packaging (unlike what's pictured in the product photo), and with the battery already installed in the device (which is itself unusual). The phone failed to even power on. Tried with a known-good battery. No luck.

"BLU VIVO 5 Smartphone -5.5"" 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 32GB +3GB RAM - Gold",BLU,199.99,5,"I purchased this phone about a month ago for my wife. She has a Samsung Note 3 a flagship phone from 2013, which is still running perfectly fine, but decided to get this for her to test the world of unlocked phones. A couple of years ago the mid range phone market was non existent, fast forward to 2016 the selection can be mind boggling.This review will be a comparison between the two phones and her experience. BTW my carrier is T-Mobile and coincidentally they have refurbished Note 3's for $199.Features/Specs/Performance:Both have fairly large screens. The Vivo 5 coming in at 5.5"" (720p) while the Note 3 at 5.7"" (1080p) super amoled. Looking at the screens side by side she says can't really tell the difference in sharpness, both screens are vivid and vibrant with color. However, I Vivo 5 does get a bit brighter. The Note 3 has a stylus, while the Vivo 5 doesn't.Both have 32GB of internal storage and 3GB of RAM, the Vivo has an 8 core Mediatek processor vs the Snapdragon 800.Both running Android Lollipop (Note 3 upgraded from KitKat) with their respective skins, I'm hoping BLU keeps it's promise of Marshmallow. My wife grew accustomed to Touchwiz, so I download Touchwhiz Apex Launcher from Google Play to keep her Android experience fairly the same.Camera: Both sport 13MP rear shooters, in good light both produce very nice images. I would give the edge to BLU because of the software and options for full manual control. The front facing camera on the Note 3 is 3MP while the Vivo 5 has a 5MP, both are just good at best.Performance: Both performed equally well, both are very fluid, smooth and no lags at all. Her daily tasks include...social media, phones calls, texts, Google Calendar, Cozi, Photo Editing apps, Web Browser and online shopping. She also dabbles with Video Editing with an app called KineMaster and both phones handle HD video with ease.In conclusion, today the market is saturated with a ton mid range unlocked phones and the BLU Vivo 5 is this one of them. It's aimed at users that do not need the top of the line specs and hardware but is still able to provide full functionality. Would I recommend this phone to that type of user? ABSOLUTELY!",17.0,4

Not because i got in a special prize but this phone is really awesome! you wont regret having this phone. It functions like a a branded phone and really gives you a good use. the features of the phone are same like the branded phone we have. what i like most about this phone is there camera. the camera is really special and very clear once you capture a picture. another thing special about it, if you're a selfie addict like me you will definitely loved there camera. they have this feature in the camera that when you smile, the camera will automatically capture the image without touching the button! it is really cool! i was consume with it for an hour taking pictures of myself! when i first got the phone i only charged it for 2-3 hours and after that i used it, the battery last long. which is really good. Plus inside the box, it includes charger, headsets, a phone protector and screen protector. which is really cool! the screen is very wide. i enjoyed watching some movies and videos there. one thing i wanted to improve there is the phone storage. i hope it is more. but one thing another good about is you can extend the memory of your phone by putting a memory card on it. I really love this phone so much! i recommend this phone to all because it is really cool! it can be considered the best and be included in the branded phone that we have. you will not regret buying this phone because it is really awesome. i receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review.",1.0,4

It has many features I can send a text message or email simply by asking my phone to do it. I can also get directions, set a reminder on my calendar and a whole host of other features.Overall I am extremely satisfied with this phone.

Full touchscreen phone arent for me. This looked like an ideal fit and afeter a few weeks of reseach and delivery wait the phone has not disapointed.The build quality is good. It feels expensive yet thin and light. I'm a long time Nokia users and still getting used to the 4 key wide keypad but so far so good.You can configure most of the display on home page with ease. Joining wireless network was easy. The touch screen is a little ""touchy"". Sometimes when you are scrolling it enters a menu. Other tmes it goes two deep yet most of the time it works well. I figured thats just me getting used to it but will see over time. This unit has 5.65 I called Nokia support and V6.0 should be available for my serial number phone in less than 4 weeks. This update reportedly helps the touch screen be more consistent. Will report an update on that if and when...The menu structure is pretty straight forward. As with any new device it takes a few days to get to grips with where everything is. Im really happy with how the OS works for exmaple if you miss a call you can touch and hold that notification and it will give you options to call back or text the person etc. Well thought out although if you are like me and dont read the manual it took a few times expermineting to find these hidden gems.Call quality great. Bluetooth connections easy and functional.OVI store is inconsistent but I didnt buy it for web browsing so that may be my lack of familiarlity and need to explorse/solve rather than a phone issue.Keyboard is a little stiff. After a few days you get used to that. Screen quality is good and overall Im more than happy with my purchase. At $144 for the back one Im delighted and my wife is thinking about getting the pink one.Very happy. Would have 5 stars if the touch screen wasnt quite so ""touchy""",0.0,3

Verizon LG enV3 VX9200 No Contract 3G QWERTY MP3 Camera Cell Phone Red,LG,18.22,5,"Review of LG enV3 (VZW) Basic PhoneDelivery & Packaging – I was pleasantly surprised to receive this so quickly. Vendor ships very promptly. Delivery was within 3 days, much sooner than the projected week to two weeks. I was a little disappointed in the packaging. Phone was wrapped in a plastic bag as was the charger in its own bag. There was no protection for the item so it rattled around inside the box. Fortunately, no damage was detected.Device Appearance – Like new appearance, with minimal blemishes. Of note was the Verizon logo inside the flip had been painted over and minor scuffing top right of the inside display. This was to be expected for a refurbished device. This is a factory refurbished device. OS reset to factory condition. Some keys are brighter than the others, most likely due to replacement. (Newer keys) All keys function as expected. No other cosmetic blemishes noted. Outer casing is flawless, minus normal wear/tear. Case is in good shape, port covers have been replaced and are intact. Hinges are tight and unit flips open properly & smoothly with the expected “catch” at first open position.Audio & Visual Capabilities – Both internal and external displays illuminate brightly. Pictures are displayed sharp and crisp, making configuring to personal tastes simple. Speakers sound as expected with this device. Although I don’t listen to music with this device, sound quality is acceptable should I choose to. Device accepted my MicroSD card, formatted and saving as configured.Connection – Activation on the Verizon Network proceeded flawlessly with the exception of data transfer. That, however, was not the fault of the phone, rather, the Network.Sound Quality – Both external speaker and internal speakerphone performed properly and clear while in call. No distortion at higher volume.Conclusion – This is a phone I would recommend to anyone needing a quality basic cellular device with texting capabilities. The keyboard feature is probably the most convenient and useful feature. It is attractive, compact, and responsive. Don't let the size deceive you, this little device delivers quality in a compact & attractive package",0.0,4

The screen size is perfect for me and the ability to customize is just about limitless. The quality of pictures I downloaded onto it are simply amazing. The only thing I've had trouble with is the rotational aspect of the phone - knowing that not alot of the apps allow it.,0.0,4

CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Gold),CNPGD,59.99,3,"My son wanted a watch. So, I researched all over amazon's choices. This watch seemed to be excellent. It came in, I didn't even open it, just gave it to my son, excited. He's 14 and a tech junkie. He took one look at it and tossed it aside. He's about 6 feet tall and a big guy. So, it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him. He said the watch face, itself, is much too huge, too thick, too big for him to wear. He didn't like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it, altogether and wasn't interested in it any further. He left on the table beside him and didn't give it a second look even though I advised him all it could do. Nope, not even remotely interested because it was too big. I tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him. I've still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago. I'm keeping it though, hoping that one day, it will be useful to me. I'm thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes. But, I, really, can't speak up on it. I haven't used it. No one wants to wear such a thick faced watch. So, the technical features have not, yet, been experienced. So, if, I do take the time to find someone to use it, I will be sure to update you on that.

Also, the screen would freeze and glitch. The camera was excellent for quality of photos, but with extended use, appears to have been slowed. Recently, the phone has been losing 4G signal, as well as not receiving/sending texts and calls as it had done effortlessly previously. Additionally, the GPS is not strong in this phone and constantly ""reroutes"" when on major roads...In the past several days the screen has started to lose the ability to show certain colors and will put static lines throughout, which renders the screen nearly unreadable.

(Model#: X511 BLACK)",,97.59,5,"I bought this phone originally to use as a small media player but ended up getting phone service for it. Pros and cons based on personal experiences are listed below. Overall I absolutely love this device and couldn't be happier with it.Pros:-- the price! The phone was priced at $30 when I bought it. It's very hard to get a decent no-contract unlocked Android phone at that price.-- great size if you're looking for something small. I only know of one other type of Android phone that has a similar size but didn't like the appearance, and the OS version was older.-- clean, minimal, slick appearance-- although the resolution is low, the small screen size makes the resolution look decent. This isn't an ideal phone, however, for someone with very poor vision since the text is small. It can be increased, but since the phone size is small increasing the text size means fewer words on the screen.-- great sound quality via headphones, and the sound output via the speakers was very loud given the size of the phone. A possible ""con"" is that the lowest volume setting above mute is still a bit loud, but some people might like that.-- runs Android 4.4.2, which for my needs was just fine. I do not know if any version updates are planned, but there was a small OS patch available to download. The OS version after the patch was still 4.4.2. Phone service was not needed to get that patch.-- zippy response time given the slower processor speed-- runs streaming apps without any problems, including Spotify (had to use a version from a year ago to be able to sign in), Jango, and Pandora. I haven't tried any others. Spotify music can be downloaded to the external SD card.-- streaming videos work ok (only tried Netflix and YouTube) although it seems the frames per second is lower on this phone than with higher-end phones. If you only plan on using this for listening to videos you should be fine, but given the size and the noticeably slower FPS it's not the best phone for actively watching videos. I did not try download any videos so I can only assume that works.-- games work surprisingly well, although I only tried Angry Birds and Ball-Hop. I don't know if anything like Grand Theft Auto would work on this phone, nor do I know why you'd try.-- apps CAN be installed to the SD card-- works with 64gb cards (at least my card works fine, I'd think other 64gb cards would as well)-- battery life. No it's not the greatest, but how much battery life can you expect in a phone of this size? The battery is small physically since the phone itself is small. I can go a day with light usage (web surfing, checking email, a little music streaming, etc.) and not run out of power.-- very lightweight. I've had the phone for several days and still can't believe how light the thing is.-- worked beautifully with a bluetooth keyboard (tried one made by Newtrent). I have not yet tried audio over BT.-- FM radio, and I mean real FM, not an app that plays FM stations over an Internet connection. You'll need headphones however.Neutral:-- keyboard usage is difficult, at least on the stock keyboard and the third party keyboard I installed, due to the small size of this phone, but this is understandable given how small the device is. I have relatively small fingers, so if you have big/fat fingers you might have a lot of problems entering the correct keys even with auto-correct. If you want a really small phone, you're going to get a really small keyboard. Voice recognition works fine, so you can speak words instead of typing them out whenever the voice option is available.- limited storage unless you use an SD card, although given the phone's price I think this is an understandable limitationCons:-- IMPORTANT: the phone uses a micro USB cable *BUT* it requires a cable with an extended tip. I tried many standard micro USB cables and in all but one the metallic tip wasn't long enough to charge the battery. In the one that did have a tip that was long enough, the connection was loose and I had to keep adjusting it to get it to charge. The cable that comes with the phone works great, including for transferring files, but if you lose that cable you might be out of luck. DO NOT LOSE THE CABLE THAT COMES WITH THE PHONE!!-- outgoing phone sound can be slightly muffled (I only tried over AT&T and a wi-fi voip call), but spoken words are still understandable. Incoming audio was fine. If you want a phone for hours of talking, this probably isn't your best option-- camera photos are low quality. They'll probably do fine in an emergency, such as an auto accident or something else where you have to take photos immediately, but otherwise you probably won't be using the camera. And there's no flash.",106.0,3

I went to one store in Arizona and one store in Oklahoma, both of which told me they didn't do software updates on that phone anymore. Then, we discussed the possibility of upgrading to a new phone. That was when I found out the guy who activated the phone put me in a two-year contract with a no-contract phone. Then, I had to call Verizon and speak to various supervisors several times to convince them I wasn't even supposed to be in a contract so there shouldn't be an upgrade fee. Finally, one person realized that I really was NOT supposed to be in a two-year contract so she changed the records. In spite of that, Verizon still wanted to charge me an upgrade fee.

A few notes about some issues users report.1. The phone as of 2016-05-18 did NOT work on metropcs, so save your time, at least not in my area. T-Mobile and ATT are fine. I believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs, that's incorrect. It will work on any network that accepts unlocked GSM phones.2. The usb charger is not hard to work around, all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug, take a hardware store razor blade, and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part, it's really not difficult, and there's no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable, I just cut away at about a 45 degree angle and a standard cable fit fine. The case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body, so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other. Without this cable mod, the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable, with it, it's fine.3. Standby battery life is quite good, but when you use it for anything, the battery drains fast, but that's why it only weighs 52 grams, you can't expect a tiny battery to have a long life, that's not realistic.This little phone is amazing, they've actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device. Typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny, but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingers.In terms of size, this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone I have.I can't think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc, and for me, I prefer this small size, I almost never carry my full sized smart phone because I just don't like that size.I won't know for a year how durable this thing actually is, but honestly, at the price, I don't even care if it fails, you can buy 12 of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy, and they aren't nearly as adorable.",3.0,4

"Sony Xperia X unlocked smartphone,32GB Black (US Warranty)",Sony,399.99,5,"#First Impresion.My last phone was Samsung Galaxy Duos and I upgrade my phone to this one looking for a phonewith much faster performance and better build quality, since I mostly use my phone for communicating with people,taking pictures once in a while and watching random youtube videos.I bought the white version and so far I really love the build quality!The quick charger works pretty well. It took me around 1 hour to fully charge the Xperia X from 30% to 100%.(Since I came from a very old phone) The camera is great, the screen is gorgeous andthe phone size is just perfect for my hand.# 2 weeksAfter two weeks using this phone I just can say that I really enjoy using this phone.The battery life can sustain for 1.5 day if you don't use the phone often (just chatting, looking social media, browsing a little bit).But if you use it for gaming, it can only last for 3-4 hours. Since I only use this phone forcommunication, and some browsing, it's totally fit the purpose. And the quick charging feature also works fine.Again, camera is superb for me. And the dual front speaker is also great to listen.Also, I have never experienced any lagging so far.Last thing, I realized why the build quality of this phone is so beautiful when I tried to compare my phoneto my friend's iPhone 6s. And it turns out that their build quality are similar.The only difference is that this Sony phone is thicker, which is still acceptable for me.Some negatives that you might experience:- fingerprint sensor is installed, but you can not use it in US version - that's unfortunate,- i occasionally miss-type on the swift keyboard - somehow i feel it is too dense.But other than that it's just a great phone.Since the price of this phone is a little bit cheaper than a new iPhone SE 16GB,I will easily choose this phone over the iPhone SE.",1.0,4

BLU Studio C Super Camera -Unlocked Smartphone - US GSM- Orange,BLU,99.84,4,"PROSGood pictures (though not as good as an iPhone)Good voice qualityGood display, big screenDual sim (need micro sim, not the type most common in older phones)Low priceTakes up to 64G SD cardComes with case and screen protectorCONSWi-fi connection can be pretty sketchyInternal memory leaves limited room if you have a lot of apps that can't be stored on SD cardThis is a good phone for the price. Voice quality is good, pictures are good, display is high-quality (and screen is fairly big), and sound is good through headphones. OS works about as well as you can expect, and, with the 64G SD card I added, I can store whatever I want, including all my music. You should be aware that it's getting harder to store apps on a memory card, though, and the limited onboard storage of the BLU means that it's possible you could run out of room.The dual sim is also great for those traveling overseas.Be clear that this is nothing close to iPhone quality. I'm happy with the picture quality, but I've photographed the same scene at the same time as a friend has done it with her iPhone, and the quality difference is pretty clear (the extra $400-500 for the iPhone does buy you something). Also, this phone doesn't do too well with wi fi, so for those who are trying to save data, that may be an issue. I try to use wifi whenever I can, but have learned that sometimes it just won't work (in places where I know the wi fi signal is fine). But, if you want to save money and are willing to accept some compromises, this is a good buy. Even used iPhones often cost more, and with the crappy storage they often have, you're SOL unless you want to pay the outrageous prices for for their stupid proprietary storage cards. And, for those trying to pinch pennies, this comes with a case and screen protector, so you don't have to spring for those. The case is no OtterBox, but it's fine for moderate abuse.One other caution--if you store your phone in your pocket, and you don't have very big pockets, you're going to have to find another storage option. I'm an average-sized male, and even for me, if I sit on the ground, I can feel the thing poking up into my thigh.",3.0,4

After a couple of months using it, it has performed well. 1 con is that this phone seemed to have been locked for AT&T previously, and though it was unlocked I had some problem trying to use internet sharing (tethering), A message popped up telling me to get an unlock code from AT&T, after a long search on the web I found a procedure to make it work with other mobile operators.As nokia lumia is promised, the screen has not been scratched, and I don't use a screen protector, really amazing !!!",0.0,3

Grandstream GXV3240 Multimedia IP Phone for Android VoIP and Device,Inmarsat,199.99,1,"I bought this to use with Skype. I thought it would be an upgrade from an old NEC Skype phone that I have, since it does not have a camera. This phone is a tablet. You can install apps, has touch screen, you can send the image to the TV using HDMI, has an USB portwhere you can even connect a keyboard (I tested and it works). It also has WIFI, network port, the speaker is pretty good, there is a SD slot, you can choose multiple languages...Why did I give only one star? Because it is a TELEPHONE and it should at least do what you expect from a telephone, which is:* If someone is calling, the phone should ring.* When you pick up the phone, you should be able to talk to the person that called you.* If you pick up the phone to make a call and the phone has Skype and another VoIP, it should ask you which one you want to use to make the call. NONE of these things can be done if you use Skype. I opened a support ticket (20140825134330) mentioning exactly those 3 items and here is their answer:""Unfortunately we have to confirm it. Our level of integration with Skype has not reach that point yet."" You still can use Skype, but like a tablet. If that is what you need, then buy a tablet, you don't need the headset, the extra buttons and the bulky body! Also, it would be nice if the phone had a connection to a regular phone line (like the NEC has). Since the camera has limited mobility, if you put the phone on a table the camera will be against the light (if your room has lights mounted on the ceiling). I connected a Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910 to the USB port, but it did not work. It would be nice to be able to connect an external camera, so you can position it in a better angle.

Phone is pre-registered & sim card is installed.",Samsung,349.95,4,"the phone work great. however, i paid for two day shipping for the item to arrive on the 14th so i wouldn't have to be without a phone. the phone was delayed and did not arrive until friday, meaning it took 4 days to arrive and I was without a phone for two days. Also, the charger that came with it is by far the cheapest charger I have ever used. Would have been better if it would have come without one so I could have gotten my own. Its already broken after just using it for the weekend. Its connected but the phone still says connect your charger. Looks like this will be another day without a phone which is very frustrating. The product is no good if I don't have a working charger for it. I'll have to go buy a samsung charger today.",2.0,0

I use prepaid no contract service by Straight Talk. I wanted a phone that was going to be heavy on my pockets. I was searching on Amazon for phones when the Blu Studio phones came up. I have never heard of Blu Studio so I was curious. I had read several reviews from customers and was please the majority of the reviews I read were very favorable. I decided to buy the Blue Studio 5.0 HD in pink. I have had it now for about two weeks and I love it. Setting up the phone was easy. I just popped my slim card in from my iphone and I was up and running. I love the large screen, great volume, excellent picture taking and 4G speed. I have no complaints. My 19 year old daughter was also in the market for a new phone and recommended the Blu Studio 5.0 HD and she loves it. She said she couldn't be happier and we both love the affordable cost. We are so glad we didn't spend a lot of money on one of the other top cellphones on the market. I will definitely buy a another Blu Studio in the future when I'm ready four another upgrade again. I would like to try the Blu Windows phones it looks like a good phone.",91.0,4

Samsung SGH-T989 Galaxy S II 16GB White Android Phone - T-Mobile,Samsung,109.74,1,"I bought this phone for my daughter because everyone else in the family had upgraded their phones and she wanted to as well. Whne the phone arriced she was very excited, and when we put the battery in the phone it had 100% charge. Since this phone needs data to work properly (like most smartphones) we got her data and she went to use it and it was working fine.. until 20 minuets later, the phone was at 50%. When she went to charge it, she would have to hold the charger into the phone MANUALLY just for it to get a charge. When she did so, the phone would charge but it would only go up about 3 or so percent in around 20 minuets. She told me that she had to set her phone a certain way on her bed just so the charger port would accept the charger cord to get a charge. Many times now she will set the phone a certain way and plug it in, and the battery be less than it was before she plugged it in. It is EXTREMELY frustrating to know I can't get a hold of my daughter when she's at school or away from home because her phone can't keep a charge. This seller sent me a deffective phone. The charging port was broken when they sent it to me. They would not let me send it back. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE FROM THEM.

The phone, despite being a last generation Xperia Device can take anything you throw at it. Any app, any game, it'll heat up to a point, but not enough to shut it down or damage the device. Heat is only natural for these devices as there are no other ways to disperse the heat besides the built in heat sinks.

Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl-Zeiss Optics Camera - White,,99.99,1,"I've only had the phone for less than a month when it suddenly died on me. I tried charging it, turning it on/off, pressing different buttons, etc but nothing happened.I left it charging for a couple of hours (though, the phone was charge before it died) and nothing happened. I tried moving and twisting the charger and all of sudden when I plugged/unplug the charger from the phone itself, it started charging. So my assumption was, the charging connector is either loose or damaged.Since this was thru a 3rd party vendor, it was hard to get a replacement phone right away. I had to basically return the phone, order a new one and then get my refund.I talked to an Amazon rep who didn't give me any options but to process the return and that was it. Somehow, I got disconnected from that rep and I called back. Thankfully, the 2nd rep was kind enough to offer me a free expedited shipping so I was able to get a replacement phone in 2 days.It was so inconvenient to not have a phone that I mainly use for home and work.For a less than a month old phone, it should have lasted longer than my original Nokia Lumia (2 years).",1.0,0

Seller has received the returned item since Jan-27th and still has not refunded me nor give me the status of my return.I have already bought another one from Amazon direct...it is an OEM, unlocked phone & working perfectly though a bit more expensive...at least you're getting the REAl McCoy!!!Hope this helps you in the future when you want to make a purchase on Amazon...Always go for sold by Amazon or fulfilled by Amazon ... their product is excellent and return is Hassel free!!!",51.0,0

Is a spare battery available? Gorilla glass or, should i get a screen protector?Update: Aug. 6; Received the phone today! 5 Stars based on the features. I took a chance based on the $69 Amazon price for this phablet. My questions were resolved very positively. 9 sensors! Makes this a good candidate for astronomy tools, as I hoped. Gorilla Glass 3, stated by support. Included case and screen protector with my shipment. Front and rear flash for the cameras. Dual LED flash for the rear camera may give a range of white balance for HDR photos. It looks great for the future....Oct. 14. 2015 - 2 months into my ownership and I am writing this update on the phone so, there is that.The amazing thing is ... A week ago I pulled up my pants and this phone flew into the toilet. I not so quickly romoved the covers and battery, laid out to dry and, moved my sim to an older phone. The next day my 4 year old grandson came to with the reassembled 'damp' phone. The rear LEDs are shining like nuts, I panic, fieldstrip it again and toss the parts in a box. I try it this week and, it's OK!I am very happy as this has exceeded almost all my expectations. 1st month I kept pushing the limits until I had 160 apps and, couldn't update any apps. I backed off to about 130 for the past month and it has gone well. I installed the 64GB microSD, added tape to the back of my SIM to make it more secure and, packaged the phone in the supplied gel case and screen protector. I try to keep it in my shirt pocket from which it falls from chair height weekly...I do wish I could use the camera(rear) in low light more easily.",23.0,3

Posh Mobile Micro X S240 GSM Unlocked Smartphone - Pink with SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC UHS-I Card with Adapter,,97.59,5,"Picked this little gem up in the spring when my previous Android phone of many years simply got too old to use without heavy modification. I'd been a huge fan of the small-sized HTC Aria phone and was disappointed with my phone plan's selection of gigantic and pricey ""upgrades"" for this year. A web search about the smallest smart-devices of 2016 turned up an article mentioning the Posh Micro phones, and after a bit more sleuthing around since the little guy almost seemed too good to be true I ordered one here. Have not regretted my purchase one bit and I recommend the Posh Mobile Micro phone to anybody looking for something tiny like me!Pros:- Exceptionally portable & handy. It fits in my skinny jean pockets, my small purses and my tiny hands!!- Sturdy plastic case and screen has held up exceptionally well to accidental encounters with the pavement & tile floor.- Easy to pick-up Android interface and file manager. It didn't take long to get everything set up on it like on my old phone. Has very reasonable text size settings within it so if you find the text in menus to be too small, it can be easily adjusted.- Added unexpected bonus: Plays some games pretty well! I was surprised because I wasn't expecting this at all. Anything with lots of menus like Ingress shows up too squished to read, but puzzle games like Marvel Puzzle Quest work fine.Cons:- The USB charging port requires a specialized micro USB cable (which comes with the phone). I'm not sure if it's the port itself being finicky, or the special cable (since I only have the one and cannot test it) but sometimes it takes a little experimentation to get the cable to sit the right way for the phone to charge. This can be a pain on the road when driving in a car as the phone can sometimes easily slip away from the USB charger.- The small phone size means the screen is WICKED small, so the digital keypad takes some getting used to, or may simply be impossible to use if your fingers are large. Since this sized screen is probably beyond even the general min-spec for mobile, you'll sometimes bump into cramped or hard to read layouts in apps and websites. For my needs, this hasn't been a problem but I wanted to note that this wouldn't be a great phone for folks with big hands or with troubles viewing small-sized text.",3.0,3

Amazing.Big, fast, crystal clear screen, great camera, excellent build quality.To anyone reading these reviews, thinking about buying one? Just do it. Its worth it.Battery life is great, as advertised. The huawei ui doesn't give you an app drawer, but it is very user friendly. I would highly recommend this device.The multi tasking abilities of this device are top notch, and the octo-core processor speeds everything along without issue. Thankfully, the battery is also big enough to power this beast, giving you around 14 hours of moderate-heavy usage with the stock battery saver turned off.More than adequate storage with minimal bloatware (mainly consisting of stock Google apps) makes for nearly 11 gigs of user available memory.My wife purchased the note 3 (quad core, LTE version) the save time as I purchased this, and I have to say that spec wise, the mate 7 blows the note out of the water. On the other hand, it doesn't have the s pen with handwriting features.If you don't need a phone with over the top bells and whistles, and you're simply looking for a solid performer that can handle anything you throw at it, all while looking beautiful in the process?

I can use the calendar, alarms (vibrate or chimes), I can also set the ringer to vibrate or ringtone or both. I can take pictures, record video and voice recordings, and the sound quality is great. I also added a 32G mini sd chip for storage, and the watch has a handy file manager that shows the album covers to all of music, once I select the song. The Fm radio is terrific; the watch comes with a set of headphones that work with the watch, and the software interface is as nice as the ""Brand"" name that this watch looks identical to. (Sams#$% Neo 2 wink) This smartwatch provides an excellent hands free way to receive calls. It has a quality build and the band is a very soft and flexible silicon-like rubber. My only complaint at all with this watch is that it easily synced all the contacts from my iPhone, yet it didn't transfer the numbers, only the names. Still troubleshooting that. For the price, the look, and the fast phone functions on your wrist, this is a great buy and I am hoping it will have a decent lifespan. Will update if anything odd or unfortunate happens.

"Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Nokia,79.0,5,"While most people clamor for Blackberries or iPhones or the latest Androids, I found myself eager to get back to the first brand that I ever used: Nokia. I won't lie - while I find the features of today's smart phones finally starting to live up to the hype, I am just unwilling to pay 100 dollars a month for all the service and contract craziness that comes with it. The average iPhone, for example, can cost over 3 thousand bucks over 2 years. I can't stand locked-down, over priced products that fail to really create compelling value for users that pay for the total package. Many companies, in their quest to make a buck off us, prohibit certain features or limit usability in ways that I always find frustrating. An example? 10 Dollars a month to use the Nuron's GPS feature through T-Mobile - when in fact you can and should be able to use it for free. My old Motorola wouldn't so much as let me copy 1 inferior quality, .3mp photo on my desktop without data charges, or picture texting charges. Stuff like that makes me want to just end the service and throw the phone in the can.Enter the Nokia 5800:With just a texting and voice plan, I am able to use 90% of the features of this phone. GPS works, and works great so far - the trick was to turn off assisted GPS and download maps straight to the device with the Nokia OVI suite. Then, using the built in GPS for all navigation needs was possible (including Turn-by-Turn Directions). The suite, by the way, also allows you to back up your device and sync it in different ways and edit contacts and things like that. This is usually an extra-cost item you have to pay for. And why should you? Losing your contacts alone would be a HUGE step backwards for most of us, and my opinion is that such protection should be standard across the board. Especially as our phones become more central organizers in our lives!Wi-Fi is a great substitute for paying for 3G services, but 3G will be there when and if you need / pay for it. You don't really need net services anyway if you aren't downloading any of the FREE apps, themes, games, etc. that the OVI store provides. You also don't necessarily need e-mail to be harassing you all the time while you are on the move. Heaven help you if you think you can web-browse and drive! Trust me, I used to have a blackberry for work which CONSTANTLY buzzed me with the days emails - the phone became a source of anxiety rather than a handy tool. With Wi-Fi, I can connect at the restaurant, store, or friends house I am hanging with, or at school, and have full access to extra content or web-browsing without worrying about X-Mobile's extra charges. It also provides me with a nice 'not now' feeling when I really do need to get away from work! One does have to constantly specify Wi-Fi instead of ""X-Zones"" in my case - but you can change connection priorities to help the ensure the phone doesn't jump on the information super-rip-off without your consent.Those two features alone make this phone really stand out to me, however there is more! The touch screen is responsive, and if you can't get it done with your stubby fingers, the included stylus does the trick. The screen is about big enough, and fonts can be enlarged for readability. I won't lie though, as with other phones, I wouldn't spend much time 'browsing' the internet - only things like checking email (easy with yahoo or google so far) or checking the weather, or seeking out an app make sense to me at the moment. Otherwise, I find that I probably wouldn't get much done at all without the stylus (just not enough screen real-estate to really handle today's typical sites). I do find that the auto-rotation of the screen gets worse when multiple apps are running (fails to rotate), but if one tips it right (think, parallel to the floor!), it works every time. I can type rapidly and accurately, and enjoy it more with the vibration off and just a small beep on. This was key for me, since I've used different touch screens and qwerty keyboards and often just can't do it with my blunt fingers. My only issue with the Nokia is that the full-screen qwerty touch does not put some common symbols on the primary screen, symbols like @ for emails or ) for smiley faces (hey I like to be friendly). They are an extra tap away. Otherwise, I have been impressed with the typical responsiveness and speed. Obviously, we all wish our phone were big as a laptop at times, or as small as a credit card at others. I think Nokia's compromise is good - the phone feels and looks small, is light, and doesn't feel any more burdensome than my old Motorola flip. Brightness is more than adequate except in direct bright sunlight, where it really washes out, and text is very clear. It really seems higher res to me than it is, and font sizing is changeable pretty much everywhere, and zoom is available if needed.The latest symbian update allows a seemingly infinite number of contacts on the home screen (previous was 4 - yuck), and did link to my primary emails without a hitch, and I can manually update to read them when I think I want to! I especially like that the contacts on the home screen are 'tracked' - I can see texts for example, that I've exchanged with just that one person, and send a new one. Graphics are cool (if not as polished as some of the newer phones) and the UI in general is pretty straightforward once you spend some time with it. I do find myself getting lost a lot however, or forgetting where certain settings are, though, this is not different to me than other phones I have used - some things are always front and center, other things get buried in sub menus. It would be nice if Nokia used some of the new nifty '3d' effects like pages turning or things moving when menus were changed, to help give a visual cue that you are 'interfacing' with the UI, but again eye candy versus capability? I would rather have control than better visuals when it comes down to it.""Express Music"" should mean that media is no-problem with this phone, and so far, I am impressed with the overall sound quality of the phone and the included headphones / mic, though the quality of those headphones, and the fit, is a little iffy to me (these are in-ear type, I think I prefer buds). Happy to know that they put emphasis on the sound rather than the look however. Plenty of volume by the way. The phone did an awesome job of organizing my files accurately, and provides a big in your face letter to let you know where you are as you search by album, artist, etc. They should have ported that feature to the contact list as it greatly simplifies the search! No major issues there. Also, the phone did come with 8gb of extra storage, enough for 600 or so high-bitrate Mp3s. Though, given the many uses of storage on this phone I think that I would need to upgraded to 16 gb or more to really stuff this thing with songs.Call quality has been excellent so far, both for the ear piece and for the speakerphone. The speaker phone sounds better than my laptop when playing music, more balanced and a a sense of actual bass. Signal strength has been excellent, and I'll be in the boondocks this weekend to find out how it cope there (usually service drops in and out). All in all voices sound full and clear, and I can detect problems with other people's phones (thats how good it has been so far).Camera? A dual-LED Carl Zeiss at 3.2 Megapixels. After a recent fire which burned down my building, I re-discovered the critical value of having even a bad camera on hand and available, if only by phone! Hence I am forgiving of camera phones in general. I've shot mostly indoors so far, and find that exposure ranges from unusable to good, grain is pretty bad in low lighting, but the flash is quite powerful. Focus lock is a tad slow at times, and I don't know why I get some blur even when using flash on occasion. I expect that like many cameras, broad daylight will reveal its best performance, and my good photos so far are really good. There are tons of available settings however, and all around I think this camera spanks the .3 mega pixel disaster I've had to rely on previously. But I won't be throwing away my digital camera any time soon.Battery life? This baby is rated for up to 8 hours of talk time, which is excellent. Yesterday I toasted the battery in about 6 hours from a mixture of trying out the Mp3 Player and playing with the internet, setting up, etc. I assume that when I stop constantly fiddling with this thing (oh how I love my new toy) It will go for days on normal use without a hitch. This is certainly one of those phones however, that multi-tasks, and one should remember to make sure that all un-needed apps are shut off b/t uses. The phone will not warn you, but you can check this from pretty much any menu. It recharges in about 2 hours I've found, which is really good. A charger is included, but the USB cable is data-only. Pick up a powered Micro-USB cable if you want to add a charging option to the phone. I'll be picking one up as it is generally more 'portable' than an AC adapter. I am going to GPS a 2.5 hour drive on today, and head to a low signal area. If the battery proves to be really strong, or weak in these conditions, I'll report back. Otherwise, assume that it did its job!Lets Do the pros and cons:Pros: Great Mp3 PlayerGreat GPSWi-Fi rules!Easy to transfer files8 gb memory included!Excellent Call qualityCan act as a USB wi-fi hotspot if you have a data plan (is it time to drop Comcast yet?)Well executed touch screen / stylus back-uplots of free and useful apps / wallpapers / you name it.OVI Suite makes life a little easier - backups, edits, map downloads, syncing, seamless so farEssentially UNDER priced given its capabilities (compare this phone to a 4-600 dollar newer phone)Feels like a true open-source, unlocked phone (unlike Google's ad machines and Apples prison-camp approach to technology)decent camera with functional macro lensCons:UI is not an A+ - more like a solid B.Learning curve - though not necessarily worse than other smartphones. But I have been trolling the net and thumbing the manual a lot so far.OVI not as well integrated as iTunes (but I hate iTunes anyway)Not sure what documents this thing can handle (pdfs will cost you)Your girlfriend will HATE the amount of time you invest getting set up, updated, downloaded, etc.I expected a plastic case to come with it - I got nothing. Europe only I guess. But it did come with a car mount for GPS, Headphones, Charger, and 8 gb of memory, so, I'll get over it.All in all, when I got the GPS working the way I wanted, I fell in love with this little phone - it is a true powerhouse for the price, and if it lasts, I expect it will be remembered as my first great smartphone. My biggest concern now is that Nokia has not been succeeding in the U.S. lately (though make no mistake, they are a world leader everywhere else, and innovative in their own right) and I fear that a switch to Meego and away from symbian will mean the general end of support for this kind of smart phone. This platform feels as though it could only get better, so that would be a sad loss. I feel like such a 'cheater' using this phone (buying direct from Nokia means NOT being FORCED to buy a data or GPS plan from my carrier) that I really wonder if the Nokia approach of providing an open and unlocked experience can really compete against the nickel and dime wireless economy being pushed by apple, at&t, google, verizon, and others. If I'm lucky, maybe I'll get a FREE update when Nokia decides what direction it wants to take.In the mean-time, I'll be greatly enjoying a solid all-around experience with a ton of value added for a minimal cost. This phone is the real deal, if you can live with the fact that it is not quite as polished (or large) as the more popular phones available at the moment. Though, capabilities and features have already improved through one update, perhaps another one will take it even further!Why are you hesitating? Take the plunge!",26.0,4

"LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smart Phone, 5.2"" Quartz White, 32GB Storage, US Warranty",LG Electronics,399.0,5,"The Nexus 5X is a great 'budget' phone, without very much viable competition at its price point (at least not for unlocked phones that work on Verizon). For other GSM carriers there are more options, but I would say the Nexus 5X is still the best at it's price point. For a power user, if you can pony up another 50 bucks, you would be better off with the OnePlus 3 or Axon 7. For everyone else, you can't go wrong with the Nexus 5X. The screen is top notch, and has excellent color accuracy. The camera is EXTREMELY capable, and captures crisp, brilliant images in all lighting. Battery life is acceptable: you can make it through a whole workday no problem. Performance is starting to lag behind 2016 flagships a bit, but if you aren't comparing side by side, you probably won't notice. Expect quick updates straight from Google, and a pretty long software support and update lifespan.",0.0,4

Motorola Atrix HD 8GB MB886 4G LTE Black - AT&T Wireless,Motorola,52.46,2,"We purchased this early Jan 2014. We had a lot of trouble getting it working. First of all the SIM card from the previous Atrix did not work in it. This has a small SIM card. They cut the SIM card with a special tool at phone company. So, you cannot go back the previous phone easily. We had a lot of trouble since we found out that the phone does not work after the SIM card was cut. It was a nightmare. We could not go back to previous phone. We had to go to two ATT stores to confirm the the phone was not working. We could not return the phone since the box was already tossed. Thus, we sent the phone to Motorola to get fixed. It took another 2-3 weeks to get it fixed. We just got the phone back on Jan 26, and it is working not.I am further upset since the price was dropped by $30 right after I purchased it.The con is that the screen is really sharp.

"LG Optimus L9 P769, 4G (T-Mobile)",,57.98,5,"My previous phone was an iphone 5, so this was an obvious downgrade for me. There is a noticeable lag whenever one downgrades to a slower phone, but whenever I remember that I saved $300, I stop complaining. The phone itself is very light and looks slim and sexy. The features and everything is pretty standard for any android phone. It's battery life reminded me of the iphone 5. It wouldn't last long whenever during intensive activities, but when I charged it, it would be full in maybe 30 minutes which is very quick. It wasn't a big problem for me because the chargers for androids are so cheap here on Amazon that I could have one everywhere I go.One thing that I like is that the screen is big and the resolution is great. It works terrifically for youtube and Netflix. The resolution for the camera is also quite nice with some great features like speak to take a photo.Cons: I have really big hands, but I was still unable to traverse the entire screen with my thumb, while holding the phone in only one hand. Although I think this screen size is perfect for browsing and watching videos, so I guess this problem is inevitable and just a cost of the screen size that I would gladly pay.Another thing quite noticeable is the slight lag whenever doing pretty much anything, from unlocking the phone, opening a program, pressing a text box to start typing, etc. I didn't expect it to be lighting quick for a phone in this budget category so it's really not that bad.Despite some small problems that are inherent when buying a phone for this cheap, you really can't beat the value for your dollar.

I didn't want a smart phone. Something went wrong with my ATT LG and I was still under contract with ATT so I came here to find an unlocked replacement. First I bought the Pantec P7040 Link. I was very disappointed with this phone, so many things that it couldn't do (see review of it elsewhere) But I just thought I'd suck it up until I could get another freebie with ATT. Luckily, the port was messed up so it became very difficult to charge only three weeks after I bought it and I was able to return it. Then I bought this phone to replace it. So many good things about it. The phone book is better than any phone I have owned. For example,if you accidentally miss pressing the first digit that you are calling but hit the next 3 or 4 digits, it pulls up and lists ANY number that has those 3 or 4 digits in a row. All of my other phones just would read ""No such contact"" or something to the like and you had to reenter the number. This phone was very easy to pair with the Sync feature in my Ford Escape, works great. The alarm function is much better than any others I've had too. The Pantec would only allow me to set a certain time alarm for ""Once"", ""Mon - Fri"" ""Fri-Sun"" or ""Everyday"". I work M, W, Th and get up at 4:00 a.m. so this was a serious limitation for me. This phone can be customized very easily. It is also of putting out the LOUDEST alarm that I have ever heard. I am a very light sleeper. So light that I wear earplugs and have a noise machine cranked up so I can't hear a pin drop. This works great but some phones aren't loud enough to overpower the loud noise and my blocked ears. This one does it easily. Shortcuts work well. Messaging is easy. I will say that the one downside is that the buttons are very small. This doesn't matter to me since I am very small, but a larger person may have trouble with the keys.If you don't care about all the bells and whistles of the smart phones and just want a very good phone with pretty good features that are easy to use for little money, this one is for you. I love it. If ATT offered me another phone for free right now to re-up with them, I would decline.",20.0,4

The first started out okay but the battery saver glitched the UI to oblivion so I did what any rational human being and returned it requesting a new one.The second time, I saw the replacement arrive in the mail. I was happy, finally a phone to replace my aging Nokia 822. It started out as one glitch, the battery saver and that's it. It was not as severe as the last one so I didn't worry. Now though, in the past two day this waste of money has started glitching all over again, doing nothing like it is supposed to. It is sending multiple text messages to my contacts, not receiving messages, UI glitching out.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS PHONE",0.0,0

It's simple, fast, and intuitive. Android might have the apps, but frankly its interface is clunky. Windows, in terms of looks, is right up there with iPhone even if it lacks some of the functionality. I also love its ability to manage my professional life. I never have to worry about what appointments my work has scheduled me for, because the minute I turn it on, it's all there, even if I haven't accepted the invite yet.

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Grey,BLU,139.0,5,"I LOVE THIS PHONE. I came from using the BLU Advance 4.0 which is currently $60 on amazon, and ,while a cute novelty, was a pain to use as a daily driver phone. It had terrible battery life, responsiveness and speed. But, hey, what can you expect. I was nervous that I would have similar issues with this phone since it only has 1GB of RAM running Android 5.0. However, I bought it anyway because of it's great price and apparently awesome battery. I could not be happier with this phonePROsFast and responsive: I don't play games on my phone, but do a lot of texting and media consumption. The phone has had no problem keeping up with me thus far.Spectacular Battery life: I use my phone constantly. I use to be the kind of person who kept 4G turned off to not waste battery, but now I can keep all the radios I want online and the phone will hold a charge for 1.5 to 3 days. PerfectPretty much everything else except the...CONs:Cameras: The rear camera can take some lovely pictures. And that's all of the nice things I can say. I truly hoped that the video would perform well on this phone, but to my dismay, it was 1920x1080 at 16FPS despite the 3rd party camera apps and everything I tried. This was disappointing. The front facing camera, as many have pointed out, all though it is advertised as 5MP definitely does not look like 1MP. Disappointing when taking selfies (Not that I would know).Volume: The phone speakers sound fine when playing music through the speakers, but for some reason notifications sound tinny and messed up. Also, when headphones are plugged in, the phone doesn't give very loud volume, even after checking the headphone amplifiers and such in the Android audio settings.However, I all around love this phone, and would recommend this to anyone in a heartbeat",2.0,4

It has a massive battery life and great signal. I get signal in places that my smart phone never did. It also has a working radio, which I've been trying to use in a phone for 10 years.It sends and receives SMS, but as far as I know, does not receive MMS, despite claiming to. It also claims to have predictive text, but does not, which is a little maddening for me, and the reason I took a star. I'd like to take 3 stars for that, but in battery life and call quality it is 5 stars, so I gave it 4.It has no browser, when you hit reply to a text it keeps asking you who you want to send the text to, which is maddening, but livable. Other than that, it has very few functions. I'd recommend it for someone who primarily makes calls with some texts, or for traveling.",3.0,3

Every time I got any sort of alert it would say I have 5 new messages even when I only had one new one and the rest were old. You can't reply back to anything and the UI is laggy. The watch interfaces had a small selection and none of them were to my liking. The phone option is probably the best working part about this and the option I would use the least. You can actually call directly from the smartwatch, there is a dial pad, speaker, and mic. When using the Siri​ option, it works ok but it acts as if you are calling yourself.

I want to use smartphone for ATT's prepaid plan of $2/day plus 100MB/a day option at $1. At first, I tried to activate it from att website. It went through but didn't offer the $2 option. Then I tried to pop it in my unlocked smartphone and it only gave option to buy data. I was almost giving up and going to visit an ATT store. Then at the 2nd try of chatting with att agent. Problem solved. I went on att activation page and chose the $30 plan, filled in all the info (don't need credit card info), hit ""continue"", the sim card got activated and assigned with a phone number. The I used its associated pin number to log in the newly created account. From there, I could change my plan to $2 a day and then funded the account. You can fund the account with credit card ($10 minimum) or refill card ($25). If you just want to see if att prepaid is the right plan for you, I think buying sim card alone and fund it yourself is better than buying a starter kit from att website, where you are required to buy a refill card of $25 and a $7 universal sim card together to check your cart out. What if yo don't like ATT plan? You lost $25 refill fee.After you are assigned a phone number, If your pin doesn't work. You need to pop in your sim card in your phone, Att system will send you a new pin. That was what happened to me. You also need to configure your phone with ATT APN setting, [...].

"Nokia E7-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, 8 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Silver)",Nokia,49.99,5,"Before I decided to purchase this phone, I did some extensive research by reading many reviews on Amazon, other websites and saw many many YouTube videos. Some YouTube videos were of people reviewing the phone on their own, some from Nokia and other reviews from other tech news agencies.When I opened the box and picked up the phone, it totally surprised me, it looks cool, it's a little heavy and feels very nice on my hand. It's aluminum body makes it feel and look very slick.I've been using this phone for a month now and it has been great. I just updated the software to Belle which has some great features and it has some cool looking graphics.The only thing I wanted to test right a way, was the on screen keyboard which non of the reviews I saw covered it. All of them showed the phone with the physical keyboard that is build on the phone.Well, let me tell you that the on screen keyboard is very well put together and it is very solid. I don't make many mistakes as I write and now that I have been using it for about a month, I can write much faster and with almost no mistakes at all.The OS is very well put together, works very well on this phone and I have been very happy with it. The Nokia Ovi Store is not rich with apps but it has some good and very useful apps that you can download. I have download those that are developed by Nokia and they work great. Maps and GPS works very very well with this phone and it is very accurate.The 8MP camera is great on it, takes very nice looking and very clear pictures!The great thing about this phone, is that it is unlocked! You can use this phone on any GSM network and it is compatible with T-Mobile's 3G and it may be compatible with At&T's 3G network as well. But when I use the internet, it says 3.5G which is as fast and the pages only take seconds to download. The other great thing about this unlocked phone is that if you travel outside of U.S. you can insert a local SIM and avoid using international roaming charges from your U.S. carrier. Also, the apps do not automatically sync at all times, so it will not use up your data or use up battery power.Also, this phone stands up very well to the competition, it has half of the SD RAM memory and processor speed compared to other phones. It is very fast and when compared with other popular phones, it will impress you on how fast it is and how easy it is to use the UI on Symbian Belle.The battery is very good on it, it will last about 2-3 days, depending on how much data you use at 3G speed. But if you switch the phone to the Power Save, it will use 2G and Edge. This will conserve so much battery power that I used the phone for 4 days, before I had to charge it.Overall, I love this phone and it has been great upgrade form Nokia E73. When I showed this phone to my friends who use some of the most popular phones today, they were impressed by it's looks, OS and UI.My recommendation would be to do your own research and the best one is from YouTube videos. You can see the phone in action and see it's functionality. But if you decide to buy one, you will be surprised when you receive the phone, it feels good on your hand and it looks very slick as I said before!",0.0,4

This phone is well made with a display of 1280 x 720 HD, has simple features and home screen theme yet looks good, you can customize your homescreen with whatever you like it to be, adding or removing apps in the homescreen was easy, change wallpaper of your choice, you can also add widgets and shortcuts. The phone comes with a hard Juning box, a clear casing, charger, USB, manual, screen protector, and earphone. Also, comes with a note to remove the backside yellow film of the battery before charging it and of course using it. The touch of the phone was seem so shiny and smooth, the 5.5"" fit perfect to my hand and pocket, it is slim and light to carry. The shape of the phone was about the same to my Juning M9.Z8 camera have 5 MP rear camera and 2 MP front cam, I really like the back camera of this phone, it snap a really clear pictures specially outside and closer object, I tried to take picture of flowers, my garden and it was pretty neat, I love the outcome of the pictures, I will try to upload some shots I have, It can also focus and have flash in a low light. The front camera is decent enough to take a good selfie, can't complain for 2MP, and you can choose the beauty camera mode, you can find in the top side of the camera and can adjust the setting to make it perfect. Good thing is that you can take picture while you're taking video.Connecting to wifi was fast, browsing Internet was smooth and fast.The Operating system was surprising fast, I super love how fast using this phone, browsing, watching videos in YouTube, this phone was faster compared to my other phone.Downloading apps and using it with no problem. It never freeze me or lag while using any apps, or browsing Internet, social media and playing games.I download the app to call and text my husband and friend using this phone, the call sound was clear and receive msgs in time. I also tried to call my friend using Facebook messenger and the voice sound was good.The base storage of the phone is 8 GB, and you can add more by slotting memory card, that was hard to beat. For 8 GB I had more than enough memory to download apps I want and enough storage for my pictures and videos. You can insert your memory card under the 2 SIM card, the very last bottom.The battery life that is 2800Mah was really good, it last longer than my previous phone. I use it in work all day and still have battery life when I back home. the battery life makes me happy.You can also turn on the smart wake on setting to enable.What I like, this smartphone is unlocked phone, and I can use it anywhere and have 2 SIM card slot available.Comparison:Juning Z8- Simple feature, Nice great rear camera, i attached some pictures taken using this phone and i am happy with the fast OS, longer battery life, 8 GB phone storage.Juning M9 - has gold theme apps, Nice front camera for selfie, fast OS, Battery Life is ok (Better have power bank), 8 GB phone storageJuning T5 - has a very cool feature love it, it has a iphone apps theme, Front and Rear Camera is ok, Good OS, Battery Life is ok (Bring power bank if you use too much), Phone storage is 4GBOverall, I am very pleased with the performance of the phone. I did not encounter any problem yet. So far so good. That's it for now but I will definitely update if I notice something else. The phone was provided for test and for honest review only, everything I write was based only on what I experienced while using this phone. I hope my review helps.",4.0,4

Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon,Apple,224.77,5,"I bought this iPhone 4S from the Amazon Warehouse because of the great return policy. I wasn't sure what I would receive.

The battery seems to be the original one which already shows signs of wear. Might need to replace with a new one soon.First thing I checked if the ESN/IMEI was clean which it was. It could even be activated with Tracfone in the BYOP program.Overall I am happy with the purchase although some other buyers reported that Amazon Warehouse Used - Like New meant really new.

The software is quite limited in that you can only download apps from their app center, and that to me seems to be this phones biggest short fall. I am by no means an expert on smartphones, but the software does seem a little more cumbersome to operate then other phones that friends of mine have. These are my initial impressions, but like I said, I've only had it a short time, and like with anything, as I get more and more familiar with it I'll adapt to make it more user friendly for me.

Apple iPhone 6 128GB (AT&T) - Grey,Apple,323.0,2,"I was going to give it 3 stars, but the text that corresponded with 3 stars was ""It's Okay"". I paused and thought about that for a second, and concluded no. No, it's not okay. The company that Steve Jobs built is self-destructing before my eyes; it' not okay. It was the only tech company that 'got it'. It's the only company that felt like the product was tested with normal people instead of just staff at the company. It's iOS that worries me, not the hardware.First off, the music app was butchered past the point of death. They are pushing Apple Music so hard that it feels like you are in an online store, not an offline app. It's littered with icons that basically cost money to touch. You don't have the option of having icons for songs, artists, albums, playlists, year or any other common-sense field that you may want to see in a music app. A ""Recently Added"" banner takes up half of the screen when you popup the music app in a desperate attempt to make people purchase songs from the store so they can see the banner change. You are unable to search more than 3 results at a time without navigating away from the search page. The list goes on, but I will stop here because one Amazon review won't stop you from worrying about the Music app.It also always prompts you to update your software every day, with no option of turning off these prompts. If it was another company, like HP, that did this, I would take it easy on their software and give this a 4 star review, but because I am witnessing one of my favorite companies (not so slowly) burn themselves to the ground, it's a much more emotional review for me. I knew that Apple would go downhill after Steve passed, but I didn't know the hill would be 90 degrees.",1.0,2

BLU Advance 4.0L Unlocked Smartphone -Global GSM - Pink,BLU,149.99,5,"Good phone for the money. I like the dual sim slots. This phone works with North American GSM carriers. (Some dual sim phones don't always work in the U.S.) They use the standard (mini) size sim. Inserting the sims is a little tricky, but it works. Sim slot #1 will do 3G data and voice. Sim slot #2 2G data and voice. I get the best value by using T-Mobile prepaid $30/month for 5Gb data and 100 minutes of voice and text. Then I put an AirVoice Wireless sim in slot #2, the $20/month Unlimited Voice & Text. The phone will monitor both sims at the same time, so if you are using a data session, it will still receive phone calls and texts. I like Android 4.4, because it allows you to store many apps on the SD card. Battery life is ""OK"". When I use it continuously, the battery lasts maybe 4 hours. But that's Ok.

I liked that it's 4G and still able to run all the apps she needs. I like the color of the rose gold and the feel of it is nice. I also liked that it includes the case and screen cover, that was extremely nice that they include accessories. Overall not a bad phone. For this price range it's pretty good.",1.0,3
"ASUS ZenFone 3 Laser 5.5"" 2GB RAM 32GB storage, Dual SIM - Factory Unlocked Phone - Glacier Silver",Asus,199.0,5,"This review is for the 5.5"" Zenfone 3 Laser, since there seems to be some confusion about which product people are reviewing. I bought this phone to replace a Moto G 4G (XT1045). This phone is a great deal at the $200 price point, and I have not found any major issues with mine.- SoftwareBefore I received this phone I was ready to write off the stock ASUS apps as worthless bloatware, but I'm happy to have been proven wrong. There are actually some usefull apps included stock that were not included with my previous phone Moto G, such as a file manager, flashlight app, laser ruler, and sound recorder. The Mobile Manager app is actually useful for managing battery and performance, keeping other apps in check. The battery drain notification is especially useful since it can let you know about an offending app early, instead of suddenly finding that your battery is in the red and you have no idea why. I haven't looked at any of the stock social or support apps yet. Some people have complained about wanting to remove stock apps, but I personally don't see much point. They don't auto-run so they aren't using any battery, and with 32GB of internal storage + 128GB uSD I am not exactly short on space. Note that this phone does not appear to support 'adoptable storage'. I'm not sure why they removed that feature from stock Marshmallow, but fortunately I didn't plan on using it anyway.- UII wasn't really sure what to expect from ZenUI having not been hands-on with an ASUS device before buying this one. Every vendor seems to be obsessed with differentiating through their UI, for better or worse. I figured worst case I could flash this phone over to Cyanogenmod in the near future if I hated the stock skin. However, I am happy to report that ZenUI looks and feels a lot like stock Android. People who are used to Samsung's TouchWiz may not like it. After using the Moto G for 2 years I had no trouble at all switching to this. I like that the flashlight and calculator are accessible from the pulldown menu on the lock screen without having to enter my passcode. However, I baffled that Power Boost (kills backgrounded apps to save memory) and Auto-start Manager (controls which apps can auto-start) are also accessible in this manner, as these are not apps that I would want a stranger to mess with. That's my only complaint about the UI.- BuildThis is my first phone >4.5"". I'm a fan of the larger screen when using it, but definitely not a fan of trying to bend over to pick things up while this is in my front pocket. With that said, the phone is very lightweight for its size. It is definitely lighter than my wife's Moto G 3rd gen despite having a larger screen and higher capacity battery. That does give me some concern about long-term durability, but so far I have no had any issue. External case material is metal, though I suspect this is just a shell over plastic since it does not feel or sound solid when tapped on with a fingernail. The ends of the phone contain the antennas and are encased in plastic. I generally hate phone cases and do not use them, but in this case the phone is slippery enough that I opted for a low profile rubber case from CoverOn. I definitely recommend this case to add some protection without adding much size.- ScreenThe screen looks amazing. It is bright and sharp. 1920x1080 is absolutely enough pixels for a screen this size. I have no complaints about this aspect of the phone.- CameraThe camera is great compared my Moto G, although I guess that isn't saying much. It's not like I'm looking for a replacement for my SLR, so to be honest my expecations weren't very high. I'll upload a few photos at a later time, but I'm sure you can find many other sample images in reviews elsewhere.- SoundThe phone has a single speaker on the bottom end. It would have been nice to have a second speaker on the top end for stereo in landscape mode, but that's asking a bit much for this price point. I see some reviewers have complained about it being quiet, but that has not been my experience. I keep my phone volume set 1 or 2 clicks up from silent and can easily hear it ringing on my desk from across the office at work. I suspect that those reviewers received defective units. The headphone jack, earpiece, and Bluetooth output are all in-line with what I experienced from my Moto G. I also have not had any trouble with lag during music playback like other users have reported. I use the phone every day to listen to music from the uSD card and it works great.My only complaint here is actually with the vibration; it is too subtle to work as a notification on its own. My Moto G would vibrate loudly enough that I didn't really need a notification tone. With this phone that is not the case.That's all that comes to mind for now. If I think of anything else, or if my experience changes significantly, then I will update my review accordingly.",40.0,4

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,2,"This phone started out working beautifully for the last few weeks, (although the punctuation for texting is very inconvenient and lacking). If you get a properly working phone, it seems pretty solid. The camera has bad resolution, so if you are set on a good camera, this is not for you. Overall it has good audio and is solidly built; not sure if the malfunctioning is typical or not. Last night it started acting crazy. When the phone is shut, it keeps activating the ""Voice Command"" function, and shows a microphone icon indicating that it is listening for my voice prompt. Then if there is noise, it sometimes starts randomly calling people based on what it maybe thinks it's hearing. I also think that this prevents it from going into standby mode, therefore it is wasting my battery power. I looked into various Settings menus, but it seems there is no way to shut this function off. Secondly, it has recently started pulling up a ""No Caller ID # Available!"" Alert Message in front of every text message I get, even though I can see the person's name attached message before I try to open it. Furthermore, when I try to hit ""Ok"" to acknowledge the alert, it pops right back up, over and over again, so I can't read my texts. It does this even for old texts. I tried turning it off and taking the battery out, I even tried a factory reset function, and I'm still having the same problems. I also noticed that after I reset it, when it was going through the set up, that the basic ringtones weren't playing at all, even when they said they were, I could hear nothing! And I can't hear a dial tone when I call people. Screwed up! Hopefully it's not a common issue for this phone. It would've been good until this started.",,0

For the price point this watch feels and looks pretty high end. The screen is super responsive and the UI is a bit tricky, but after 10-15 minutes I was all good with it. Charge time was decent, I went from 50% to full in under an hour. Battery life, under normal use, notifications, bluetooth connection, occasional time checking and steps, was ok, full day and it was down to about 45%. So, expect close to 2 days of usage from this watch.The bad: This is Android compatible, not Android Wear. So, there is no way to get Google Apps on this watch. You're stuck with whatever apps already come with the watch. Earpiece is the USB headphones, so you can't use any standard 3.5mm headset with the watch (I have Beats and it will not work with it).

Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,59.95,3,"This was for my son to replace a phone he damaged at work. He is a college student, but is a foreman for his scene shop, so he's always on call. He needed a qwerty keyboard because he sends/receives so many texts about things at the theatre, that it's easier. BUT, due to his job, he's always banging himself (and phone) on wood pieces, metal grating, ladders, etc. SO a full screen front was out of the question.......that's how he damaged the other one. PLUS cost was a major factor knowing he'll damage it again, probably. He liked the fact that on the school wireless he could always check email with this phone, too. Again, important to his job. This phone is NOT 3G, it is NOT a smart phone, it is NOT able to access internet/email from anywhere. Just places where wifi is available (like a college campus).All that said, it fit the bill for him very well. He likes it thus far, though he's only had it at school less than 2 weeks. He says it seems fine for what he needed it for. The reason for 3 stars is just that for MOST folks this won't do as much as they want.However, if you're looking for a smartphone alternative for a college student who is nearly always on the school interface, this works as a very nice inexpensive alternative.",1.0,3

This phone allowed me to enjoy it. For this price the build is surprisingly good. The finish of the back is not glossy like most of the phones at similar prices range so it doesn't look cheap at all. Is relatively thin and somehow I find the look elegant.The performance is in overall decent, not as smooth as my Nexus 4 (I bought this as a backup phone) but does the job nicely. It lags here and there, but it won't hinder the experience of the OS. I found the keyboard to be where the lag bothers me the most, but that because I'm a fast typist and I'm used to Android Swiftkey keyboard. The prediction of the Windows Phone keyboard is not as good as Swiftkey, but I think is in par with iOS, which is pretty good already. The apps that I use most frequently are Whatsapp, Twitter, Music player, Facebook, Linkedln and native mail app where all of them have surprised me with how smooth their performances had been.Regarding the back camera, is the weakest feature in my opinion. It serves its purpose as a camera, but don't expect it to capture fine details, even in outdoors with good light conditions. Same goes with video recording.I bought this phone to try Windows Phone and didn't disappoint me at all. For budget phone like this one, Windows Phone is the choice to go.

When I contacted them about the problem and returned it, they said they would 'have their technicians inspect it' before refunding the money. The phone most definitely did not work and they got back to me saying that their technicians couldnt find anything wrong with the phone and that they would refund me, but charge me a ""restocking fee"" since the phone was now ""used.""On top of that, they sent me fake headphones and a fake charging cord. Apple blocks unauthorized lightning cords and when I finally gave up with the phone and went to back it up before returning it, the cord never worked, never charged the phone, and couldnt form a connection with my itunes. The battery life on the phone was also practically nothing which leads me to believe the phone was either also fake or used/refurbished. Either one sucks since I paid for what was listed as a new phone and ended up paying them to take it back ""used"" - probably to sell it to someone else new again.If I could I would give 0 stars. This is a bs product from a bs company with terrible customer service and service, period.",0.0,0

Samsung Galaxy J5 J500M 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera - Gold (International Version),Samsung,177.49,4,"This J5 is unlocked for South Central and NA-only is not a dual sim, just a single Micro-Sim slot; if purchased from seller (lifeline786). The stand-alone second Micro-SIM slot is not even manufactured, just looks like an etched in plastic image of a SIM slot. So for those who are wanting both sim slots manufactured and available to use look elsewhere. FYI: works with GSM band only (like ATT & TMobile, not Verizon). If the stand-alone Micro-SIM was programmed to accept international sims then I'm sure you will not be able to have someone else unlock the phone to have it use international sims at all?! So those of you who want to be able to switch between both NA and International sims (or want to switch between two mobile accounts from the same provider or switch between two different providers like ATT and TMobile) without having to switch sim cards might want to look elsewhere.(Product Review)Cons: Samsung are making their phones lighter now by using cheap plastic casing; as a result no impact resistant at all, so buy a case to protect it from drops. I guarantee the phone will break from the first drop!Pros: Internally advancements matches what is stated in the phone's specs.",2.0,0

LG Electronics LG G3 D855 16GB Unlocked Cell Phone - Unlocked (Titan),LG Electronics,249.0,5,"I did so much research before purchasing this phone, I could have advised people on how to use their own lol. This is a clear triumph for LG. Aside from some slight overheating and the screen occasionally refusing to go full bright in sunlight due to the processor temperature, this is a dream come true. I haven't used a data plan on it as yet, but I believe that I will have no issues. I previously owned a BLU STUDIO 5.0 C HD and it was child's play compared to this MONSTER. The LG skin hasn't gotten in the way yet, and if it does, i'll just install Cyanogenmod 12 for a pure Lollipop experience.Pros:*The screen has to be seen to be believed*Effortless rear Camera (download Snapseed from Play Store to really unleash your creativity, but its still amazing without)*Selfie camera is bright and surprisingly sharp!*Replaceable battery and a micro sd slot*Fits in my big hands PERFECTLY* SUPAFAST!*LED notification comes with over 8 colours (though they don't list white, I tested it and its available!)*The keyboard is VERY impressive for a stock experience*The buttons at the back of the phone are easy to use and adapt to, in a matter of days in fact.*The specs on this beast make it future proof. It will still be a very impressive phone within the next 4-5 years at least.Cons:-Settings look better on stock Lollipop-I wish it came with more options for moving apps from internal to external storage-Wish I could uninstall some useless apps-Processor overheating (occasionally)- Screen usable in bright sunlight, but may frustrate some if it can't go 100% due to the processor overheating,Tips:If you want to make this great phone even better, purchase a ballistic glass screen protector and a Supacase protective case. your screen will be un-scratchable and the device will also be able to take a beating without any damage being done.Ensure you keep the brightness setting to Auto. The battery is great, but it will save you more. There's also a setting that lets you choose to turn the screen of if the phone detects that you're not looking at it.Purchase a 64GB micro sd card if you really want to go the distance!

It's not the same panel though as LG has fitted its new IPS Quantum Display which is says has 20 percent greater colour reproduction, 25 percent improvement in brightness and 50 percent greater contrast.Percentages aside, the display is better than the G3 (which was the first Quad HD phone to market) but it's not a huge leap. Colours do, on the whole, look better - especially whites but some look a little over the top. For example, the YouTube icon icon looks neon red like it's eaten too many Habanero.All in All this phone is one of the very few phones in 2015 with a removable battery and expendable storage up to 2tb.

With the first charge, a little bit more than 6 hours it lasted like 10 days, it gave more than 5 hours of phone calls, plus about 2 to 3 hours of radio FM playing, plus texting. The spanish/english dictionary of the text prediction feature lacks of a lot of usual words so you have to type them manually. If you're a texting person, you'll probably hate it. But it is comprensible, since this a phone made in China, but at least you can chose from a lot of lenguages to be the telephone sistem lenguage. The phone doesn't come with a user's manual, it only comes with a Quick Start guide, in english. You have to figure out the rest yourself, but if you had a cellphone before, there is nothing that you can't figure out for yourself.I havent tested the waterproof, dustproof ans shockproof features, but the phone looks and feels pretty sturdy. I've seen videos of this phone from Rusia where they literally sink the phone in a bucket of water, and apparently it survives. I believe them, so I'm not trying to proove it too.I have 2 mexican sims in it from 2 diferent companies that work perfect. You can have both sims ""on"", or just the one that you prefer. The phone was a bigger than I Though, compared to some basic Nokia phones, but my small hands can still hold it comfortably.If you are a pictures people, don't count on the camera of this phone. It is a 2 MB, with not ni a nice color capture. I felt like I was back in the 2000's phone cameras. I`m o.k. with it because I'm not a fan of camera phones, but if you mind you phone having a camera, wouldn't recommend it, even you can adjust a little bit the exposure, color and even efects on the camera.It has some basic extras like calculator, agenda, alarm, ebook reader (have no idea how it works), bluetooth.The USB charger can be used as a data transfer cable too, a webcam (have no idea how it works) or a COM port.It has a good quality sound.Is a great cellphone if you want just to be able to make and receive calls and need to have a long battery life.",2.0,3

I did pass this phone onto my mother for an upgrade but I was also surprised when my mother ( a 50 year old non- tech savvy woman) came to me and told me she loved it as well!

Well, I got the phone part to work fine with moving my sim card. I got the wi-fi to work on my home, secured network. But that was about it. Where to begin - OK, I'm in the States. Everything is celsius and metric. I can't find a way to change to English/US. Also, the temperature, (in celsius) on the main screen, has never changed. It does not show current temperature. Then, downloading apps. After a couple of downloads, like Netflix and IHeart, it said I was out of space. It came with a 2 gig mini sd card. I thought that all the bloatware was talking up the space so I got a 32 gig sd card. Still the same problem. It won't let me add apps that I want. Then there is logging on to other wi-fi's. I tried to log on to a restaurant, unsecured, wi-fi. It did not connect automatically. I had to go to settings and approve and indicate ""connect"" to that wi-fi. After that, I still could not access e-mail, etc, even though it said I was connected. I have a Samsung android tablet that I've mastered. I bought this phone because it also has android operating system. Thought it would be a piece of cake to set up and use. So far, not so. The book that came with the phone covers basics but is not a lot of help. Also, this phone is clearly intended for European use. The listed phone numbers to call for assistance are in the UK and other European countries.. I may be returning this phone since I can't get it to do what I expected.A week later: Well, I tried it for a week. I talked to the seller today and we agreed that it should be returned. ""Bobby"" at the seller was as helpful as he could be, but we couldn't resolve the problems. He sent me a return form and it's now on its was back.

Some would say the phone is laggy... but it was surprisingly zippy considering the specs are low. The camera seem to take decent photos also... all this I tested in less than a week.Now for the bad... Android 4.4.3... not a bad version but just bad on this phone. I can't even get a percentage meter in the notification bar for my battery. OK... so I decided not to nitpick with that one and went on to test other things... like a new clock widget. I tried the HTC Sense clock from the Google Play store and it doesn't work.... that was strike 2. The I decided to try my Moto 360 Smartwatch with this phone... it paired ok but the Motorola Connect app just would not work. Thought it was a BLU thing so I tried the Moto 360 on the BLU Studio Energy... it worked perfectly (I suspect it may be the android version since the Energy has 4.4.4. while the Studio Lte had 4.4.3). Throughout all this testing, I realized the Google Play Services keep crashing which rendered the phone unusable.I had to restart several times to get it to stop but the last straw was ... my T-mobile connection kept fluctuating and whenever it does work, I only get Edge speeds. Tried the sim in my Blu Studio Energy and got 4G.I was hoping I could love this phone... but with the inconsistent connectivity, buggy software and incompatibility (somewhat) with my Moto 360.... I will have to return this product.",2.0,4

Great phone, very speedy, solid call quality so far, and a very nice screen, especially for the price.---Updated review: After having this phone for 8-9 months or so, I was hasty to give it 4 stars. Turns out that:1) The phone/apps freeze fairly often (6+) times per day, which isn't too big of a deal - turning off and on the screen fixes it2) You get next to no internet when moving. Yup, when traveling in a car (passenger seat of course) or when on the train, it's nearly impossible to get any data. When the car or train stops, you'll be okay...as long as the stop is for at least 30 seconds3) Problem 2 means using GPS is VERY flawed, please don't attempt to use this while traveling and your GPS will not be updated in time for you to make your exits, turns, etc",0.0,3

"LG Quantum C900 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7, QWERTY Keyboard and 5 MP Camera - Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black",,199.99,4,"Ordered phone from Blutekusa. Came very quick and while I was worried about the New condition from other posts this phone came brand new and factory sealed just as they stated. It has a nice back cover too that snaps on in an interesting way that I can imagine the knock-offs get wrong.So far my only Cons I wouldn't even consider Cons, but areas of improvement (Updated a couple 1/19/2012 after using the phone longer):- Even though the latest Windows updates enabled it, LG hasn't turned on Hidden Wifi Access Point support, so you will need a named wireless connection for that.- Zune is needed for everything. (Including updates, no OTA Updating) It is almost a 400MB download of which the first 100MB+ file was useless and just downloaded the other. It also only installs on WinXP SP3/Vista/Win7, so pretty limited. There is a registry tweak for the USB driver to make the Storage location visible, but while I was able to see it the phone appears twice in Explorer, shows storage and available space, and won't copy anything to it. I also had to remove the registry tweak that didn't work to make Zune function again which the article never mentioned.- Phone supports HSDPA up to 7Mb download, but I only get 100K-1M even after tweaking things with the hidden MFG app. Others mention seeing the H icon too while mine only shows E and 3G. After playing with it forever and contacting LG and ATT I've just determined the phone to be defective since the MFG app even shows the module for HSDPA as inactive.- Keyboard is great, but the button for space is made with 2 contacts under it which clicks weird...sometimes even a second click is felt. It has never typed two spaces, but it does feel weird. The Shift and Fn buttons are a little hard to press as others mention, but not a deal breaker.- Discovered today that I'm unable to submit files in web forms, so uploading photos and such are out of the question.Pros:Phone works great. I have yet to have it crash or freeze. First thing you need to do is get your MFG app enabled and remove the ATT-US link so you get updates ATT isn't releasing...I didn't do this until the end and got the last update they didn't deploy now. Doing this in the beginning could have enabled Hidden Wifi, but untested. You can Developer unlock while in there for further capabilities too. I'm somewhat in agreement that it isn't 100% unlocked since I had to do this plus the fact that it has ATT Apps and Box. The latest Windows updates are nice. First phone I've had that actually reads me my SMS over the Bluetooth in my car and lets me reply with speaking. Live tiles are pretty cool and the Facebook integration works pretty well without even needing Facebook. They did a good job on the animations and talking Caller ID options too compared to other offerings. All the ports and buttons are right where they need to be too.The apps may be limited, but it has what I need and I can develop more. Netflix plays well and loud with the speaker too. It actually has 100% working IMAP Email which my Motorola Android devices didn't. (Only complaint is it puts deleted emails in a new Deleted Items folder instead of using Trash, but it works so no complaints) I was also able to sync with my Google account and link Contacts, Calendars, Emails, etc. There is also built in phone locating via GPS or remote ringing, plus remote wipe/kill. While Android and iPhone are suing each other, Microsoft is going to take over. I was originally disappointed with the way they ditched Win Mobile, but they did good with the replacement. When updating it identifies the device as a Zune Win Mobile device too, so it appears it is nothing more than Win Mobile running Silverlight. Which is funny considering Win Mobile runs on Win CE, so you have 3 layers now.In closing, if you want a phone that while limited does what a phone is meant to do and works get this. If you like to do tweaking all the time and put up with issues or things not working get an Android. If you want a phone that works one way, has no options or customization, plenty of apps, and no keyboard get an iPhone (They are actually the same size of screen, so the Quantum is like an iPhone with keyboard and options).",2.0,3

"LG Extravert 2, Verizon (Blue) - Retail Packaging",LG,64.9,3,"My rating is a warning about how sellers may be billing this product. I purchased it as a ""new"" phone from Advantage Wireless Device. What I got is an aftermarket product. I have posted seller feedback elsewhere, but I want to post it here, too, as an advisory to buyers.BE ADVISED:THE SELLER PROMISED TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY TO CUSTOMERS WHO POSTED FAVORABLE REVIEWS ON AMAZON.The product came in an LG box, but once I opened it and saw the aftermarket charger/adapter, I realized that this the box was some sort of thing LG makes available for re-sellers. As it happens, the phone is in fine condition, so I have not returned it. I do feel, however, that it was falsely advertised, and they are gaming the ratings system.As to the phone? It's fine. As I knew it would be. I needed a slide-out keyboard for mother-in-law to use for texting. Don't want to buy a whole data package for a smartphone that she won't use. Therefore, this. It is what it is. If you want to ooh and ahh about a phone, you are not buying a ""feature phone."" You are buying a Droid or an iPhone. But for a feature phone, this one is swell. Keyboard is sturdy. Touch screen reasonably responsive. Wouldn't want to type on the screen but ... keyboard.

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - Pink,BLU,2000.0,5,"I bought this phone because I wanted a backup should one of our Galaxy phones go south or MIA or to take on our next trip overseas. I'd read the reviews, most by those who I supposed expected a $130 overtake a $700 Samsung Sx! Clearly, that was not my expectation. The first thing I did was restore it via Google and moved the SIM to this phone and used it for a few days. This is a large phone, comparable to say a Galaxy Note the screen is very nice, bright and sharp. The BLU phone comes with a more virgin android 4.4.2 operating system - to be upgraded to Lolipop before the end of the year. It's just amazing how much carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile screw up a perfectly good OS! Operationally, I could find nothing to complain about. The phone comes with a case, screen protector, ear-buds with mike, and AC charger. The battery is huge and last about 50% longer than our Galaxy phones. On top of that - it includes an FM radio. I can't tell you how many times I wished my Galaxy had this (they do in Europe btw) when I am at a ball game and the 80,000 fans are sharing the same network! Yikes.

Samsung Galaxy S7 Dual Sim Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - Internationally Sourced (Middle East/Afican/Asia) Version G930FD Dual Sim- Black Oynx,Samsung,530.99,5,"Ordered from seller Wireless Circle - received on time. What a fantastic phone! The camera itself leaves my Galaxy S5 (and any model iPhone) in the dust. I will leave the details to other reviewers, but just a couple of comments on the Dual-SIM version which I bought:(a) It doesn't say you have to, but I powered off the phone before putting SIMs in. Why take a chance?(b) Both SIM's sit in the same tray, and you have to be careful that SIM 2 is still seated all the way as you push the tray back in. Any resistance, STOP, and check that everything is seated. By the way, an important note: You may NOT have a second SIM and a microSD card in the phone at the same time - they use the same slot! I don't care about this (yet), as 32GB should be enough memory, but this gave me pause.(c) You can select the default SIM to use separately for each important function: outbound Voice and Text, and data. This is a nice feature, but it's still possible to override these selections when making an outbound call, so you can get mixed up. There is also an on/off function for each SIM which prevents this, as a safety in preventing very high roaming charges!If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't get the silver color. Although it still looks classy, it also looks like a run-of-the-mill iPhone 6 haha. I liked the electric blue color on my S5 better (not available on the S7, as far as I know) - just had more of a wow factor.",7.0,4

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,578.0,5,"My three month old Moto X Pure was stolen, so I bought this one instead. This review will center around comparing the two, as they are in very similar price points. I prefer this phone to the Motorola, by a slight margin.The pros:- The size is smaller, which makes it easier to manipulate. It still is a big phone, bigger than a Moto G- It is much lighter. The difference is significant when in the pocket- Fingerprint scanner is very practical and useful to unlock the device. I thought it would be a gimmick, but it is not- The screen is brighter and has better color calibration- The main camera takes better pictures- The screen is high resolution enough (HD) while not waisting battery or processing power in pushing pixels I can't see (QHD)- Slightly faster, even though it has 1 GB less of RAM. I installed all updates right away, which may explain why I'm not seeing the performance bottlenecks some other reviewers are talking about.- Faster software updates- Easier to repair (not much glue to hold it together)The cons:- The selfie camera doesn't have as wideangle a lens as on the Moto X- No one I know has a USB C charger. Make sure you have enough battery when you leave your house!- The plastic construction has very slight creaking sounds when handling it sometimes, which is annoying (reminds me of Nokia dumbphones of yore, not that they were not durable). The Motorola felt like a solid brick. This is explained by the fact that the Motorola is glued together, while this one has a more traditional construction.- The Moto X has an SD card slot and Android 6.0's adoptable storage makes it seem like internal memory to the user, which is great. You're stuck with what you bought with the Nexus.The same:- Battery life is just as bad on this as it is on the Moto X (or any other 2015 phone). I miss my old Moto G's amazing battery life- Fast charging is just as fast and convenient on both- Network reception, call quality and modem speed seem on par",10.0,4

Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,229.99,4,"First, a caveat. The phone I received had its seal broken and the phone appeared to have been used, despite the fact that I bought a new phone. However, this is a review for the item itself, not the seller.This phone is big. Not like LG G3 kinda big but still reasonably sized. No, this phone is a monstrosity. I believe when ancient scholars concocted the word 'Gargantuan,' they had the Huawei Ascend Mate 2 in mind. It's big, it's thick and it's heavy. Nonetheless, it's not entirely unpleasant to hold, and unless you're the skinny jeans type (which unfortunately seems to be a growing portion of the population), the phone will fit in your pocket adequately. One handed use is even not out of the question for some simple tasks. However, make no mistake, this is a phone that will require both hands 80-90% of the time.The build quality is solid. I won't mistake it for the Sony Xperia Z2 anytime soon, but it's a well-constructed phone. The back has a nice feel to it.In terms of performance, this phone can handle mostly anything you throw at it. Don't be fooled by the Snapdragon 400 processor. As others have mentioned, it's a higher end S400 and almost equivalent to the 600. Along with 2 gigs of RAM, there is very little that people would want to do on their phones that would be a struggle. It's not as fast as the higher end phones (nor should it be, at half the price), but it gets the job done. Huawei's UI is fine enough and even has some useful features. There are a few minor things I don't like about it, but nothing overly egregious. I did miss the tap to wake feature found on a growing number of top tier phones. I do wish the company had followed through on its promise of KitKat for the US device already. If they want to break into the US market, faster software updates are absolutely necessary. I will give Huawei credit as unlocking the bootloader on this phone is as simple as emailing their support staff for an unlock code.Battery life is incredible. I have never seen comparable uptimes from any phone or tablet. It's truly unrivaled. With heavy gaming, time in the subway where the phone is constantly searching for signal, listening to music, bluetooth, etc. I can get around 2.5 days of uptime with 9-10 hours screen time. If you wanted to charge your device every day, you could almost literally not put the phone down the entire day and still have enough power to juice through.With such great battery life, there had to be a tradeoff, and that is the screen. It's not terrible quality, but WELL below the quality of 1080 screens. You will notice the difference when playing games, watching movies, or doing much of anything on the phone.So what would I say to Huawei as guidance on building the successor to this phone?-Improve the build quality of the device-Make it as compact as a 6-inch phone can be, lighter if possible-Enable double-tap to wake or a quicker way to unlock the phone-Faster software updates-Improve screen quality without sacrificing battery lifeI don't know if you all have seen the upcoming Mate 7 (the successor to this phone), but Huawei has managed to accomplish most everything on that list. I will be buying that phone the second it hits the United States.In summation, despite a few shortcomings, this is a very capable big screen phone, and an excellent value. I will be using this phone until the Mate 7 is available. This phone has very likely made me a long term customer of Huawei.",6.0,4
CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Black Plus),CNPGD,59.99,2,"For the price, this watch is packed with features. Here's the line-up of apps that come with it: your choice of a digital and analog watch face, but you can't add new ones; choice of 24 or 12 hour format; pedometer, but you can't change to feet and inches; barometer with thermometer in Centigrade only; BT dialer; phone that makes and receives calls of fairly good quality, but there is no volume control; phonebook with search; Bluetooth; browser that doesn't work; Sim card slot so this can be a standalone cell phone not dependent on connection to phone; SD storage card slot; call log; lost/find app; smart search; remote camera controller; sleep monitor; multimedia player; FM radio that doesn't work; calculator; Alarms; File Manager; Calendar that doesn't sync; Audio player; Messaging for SMS, but not MMS; email doesn't work; and a Remote Notifier that doesn't work.There you have a list of the apps included with some comments. It is surprising and disappointing how many of the apps are non-functional. I'd say overall it's a deal breaker. Now maybe some of the functionality could be restored is there were any customer service or technical support for this product, but there is none whatsoever. PGD Group is a horrible company that does not respond to email and offers no support. There are no additional apps available for download.The battery life leaves something to be desired. It seems two to three days is maximum depending on usage. But it does charge quickly using a micro USB cable.The tiny scrap of paper that is supposed to pass as a manual is written in the worst English you can imagine. It is just gibberish and rudimentary. Products should not be allowed to be sold on Amazon unless they come with proper documentation.I found the most frustrating thing about this Smart Watch is that it continually disconnects from the Bluetooth link to my phone with an annoying little tune even when it's only three feet from the phone.If you are looking for a fairly attractive Smart Watch that tells time and makes and receives pretty decent phone calls for a good price, you may consider this model. But with all the non-working features, I don't really recommend it. The lack of documentation and customer support are total negative factors;Amazon should not allow companies like PGB to sell on their system until they can support and document the products properly. Their customer service is virtually non-existent.",4.0,0

Apple iPhone 6 64GB Space Gray - (Verizon Wireless),,150.0,1,"I received this phone and immediately took it to Apple to have diagnostics run on it. Before they even ran tests, he noticed that the screen has a slight upward bend in it. It's so slight, that I didn't even notice it. However, if I'm going to pay $480 for a phone that is not longer under warranty, I don't want to run the risk of it breaking one month and not being able to return it. After looking up the phone, it says that the previous owner kneeled on it and cracked the screen. At this point, its more worth it to buy a phone on a payment plan through verizon with a warranty, than to risk this. I wish I was able to keep this phone because in the long run its cheaper, but after reading some reviews, I feel like the smarter decision would be to return it.",1.0,0

My daughter has been taking pictures with it, and to tell you the truth, sometimes I think they are better than my Note 2 (sans flash). There is an issue with the internal memory being only 4 gb. I did get around it but it requires rooting the phone. That's not too hard thanks to Motorola. Once I did that, I bought ""link2sd"" in the google play store which really helped with space (sd card, too, of course). DU speed booster also helped clean up some crud, and then, I went into the system files to delete old copies of android system apps that have been updated by google play as well.

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - Pink,BLU,2000.0,5,"I purchased this simply because it was on sale for $79 - you can't beat that, based on the good specs, right? In this case, the build and operating quality exceed expectations, and match that of $300 phones (and $300 phones from Huawei, Alcatel, ZTE are pretty darn good these days).Some set-up notes to help you:1. Make sure you have your old phone backed up - Android and Apple phones back up automatically. If you have photos and videos set to auto-back up on your old Android phone, they will be there for you when you log into your new phone. I wouldn't factory reset your old Android phone right away, though, just in case. If you are coming from an older iPhone, things get a little trickier. Apple iCloud isn't available on an Android or Windows phone, so you need to make sure your pictures and videos are backed up to an alternate service - Dropbox, Box, Microsoft OneDrive, Flickr or the best yet, Google+. Telling you how to do that is beyond the scope of this article, so research it online or enlist a friend's help (it can be as simple as downloading the app, signing in, telling it to upload, and being patient). Once again, don't reset your iPhone until you feel comfortable.2. You need a Gmail account to sign in onto the phone. You probably already have one, otherwise you can sign up on the phone itself.3. You need to put a SIM in. Probably in SIM slot one - read the tiny manual in the box. I'm presently trying this out in tablet mode, so I don't have the answer on the tip of my tongue. But one thing for sure - on most dual SIM phones, only one SIM can use high speed data, so it DOES make a difference. (The other SIM will probably use slower 2G data.)4. I don't recommend backing up from your old Android phone's online Google backup. It may take a little extra time to remember and manually install your favorite apps, but it's a cleaner way to install, never hangs the phone (I've had some phones just stall out), and is like spring cleaning - you'll find some apps you never use, just hogging up space.5. This is a pretty stock Android user interface, thankfully, with practically no bloatware programs. That's welcome in terms of housekeeping, and essential in terms of making the most of your 8gb of storage. I had about 5gb before downloading my apps and 4gb after, no SD card installed yet (I have a card on order from Amazon now).6. If you are going to install a micro SD card, there are good deals on Amazon, with Samsung and Sandisk very popular. 32gb goes for about $16 and 64gb goes for about $32. Class 10 UH1 at a minimum is best, and no biggie in terms of premium. Amazon's own stock - not marketplace - is the most reliable. Install the micro SD FIRST before booting up, and before you download any programs, go into Settings- Storage-Install Apps to SD card and select that option; if you don't, you can't move programs to the SD card later, without re-formatting the SD card AND factor re-setting your phone OR uninstalling then reinstalling the app. You want to use the SD card for apps and storage as much as possible to reserve on-board storage for the many programs that won't install to the SD card.7. For some strange reason, the stock keyboard is AOSP (Android Open Source stock keyboard) but I downloaded the Google Keyboard, which has swipe text entry as an option, from the Play Store. Unfortunately it kept crashing on me, ymmv, but be forewarned. Fleksy worked fine.8. To get rid of vibrate on keypress, you need to toggle options in TWO places: the keyboard settings for your default keyboard, found under ""Language & Input"", and the sound settings, of all places, under ""Audio profiles"". Root around in those two categories and you can un-check the appropriate boxes.9. While you are in ""Sound,"" un-check the box for enhancing the speaker sound; all this does on mine is make the speaker crackle at a middle volume level - with the box un-checked, it sounds like most other speakers in smartphones. It isn't a weak speaker, btw, at least not on my sample.10. In the ""Display"" setting category, turn off ""screen adjust mode"", because this has a nearly 3000 mAh battery and you shouldn't be sacrificing ANY screen quality to eke out a little more battery life. On the other hand, I left ""ClearMotion"" turned on, this is a ""Video fluency enhancer"" whatever that means, but if I end up finding the video a little weird, I'll turn it off. (This is non-standard function, btw.)11. Go into the ""Battery"" setting category and un-check the ""CPU power saving mode"" which throttles your octa core performance to ""conserve battery life and lower device temperature."" If you don't like your resulting battery life, you can turn it back on later. Please note that I turned this feature off, but when I came back to write this review, it had turned itself back on, so keep an eye on this setting.General comments:Phone box included good looking, white earbuds (no soft silicone tips) that remind me of the first Apple earbuds.Phone box also included a translucent, thin, medium soft (not gummy) silicone case with perfect fit, perfect cut-outs, easy to operate volume and on-off covered sections; a spare screen protector (there is also one pre-installed, perfectly, no bubbles); a 5 watt, super narrow (narrower than Apple or Samsung cube) charge; and a white, medium short, USB cable.I got about 27,000 on one Antutu test run and 28,000 on another.The translucency of the included case is just right so you can see the phone color but the BLU logo is subdued.The phone is super narrow for a 5.5"" screen, the side bezels are super narrow. BUT, there is a lot of bezel on top and bottom. Net result, the phone probably couldn't be any narrower, and the slim case doesn't add much to that, but it is much taller than it needs to be.The attached screen protector is clear, smooth, and doesn't seem to affect screen color or viewing quality. Since I distrust these things, though, I removed it after giving the phone an initial workout. Turns out glass underneath is pretty grabby, the grabbiest ever with an Amazon screen stylus. You won't notice this if you use fingertips, like most people. BUT if you like to use a stylus, try for a while before removing the screen protector. Since the glass doesn't appear to be oleophobic (oil hence fingerprint resistant) expect to clean the screen more often than with some phones.Since I haven't dropped a SIM in yet, I can't speak to cellular call quality, but I tried Skype and Google Hangout calls in both regular and speakerphone modes and everything sounded great.Rear cover of phone snaps on perfectly with no mismatched cover-to-body spots.Screen seems of good quality, but give me a couple of weeks and I'll update.My initial reaction is that this is a carefully designed, well-thought out, well-built phone. BLU did a superb job here.",47.0,4

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge G935FD 32GB Dual Sim Factory Unlocked - Titanium Silver,,627.5,1,"Hated sending it back but this international version wouldn't work with TMo or ATT SIMs properly. Love the S7 Edge though. This dual SIM version wouldn't handle the two carriers cellular data properly. Once on wi-fi it would rarely transition to cell data without a reboot. Even then it didn't like two SIMs from different carriers. Suspect it is meant for two SIMs from the same carrier only. If I inserted a single SIM only, it worked better, but oddly my TMo SIM only got less than 1Mbps on band 12 LTE when the same SIM in a different phone pulled 15+Mbps consistently. ATT speeds when only 1 SIM inserted were consistent with other phones. If I can only use one SIM I might as well buy a single SIM US version so that wi-fi calling and VoLTE could work too, which they don't on this international version.Beyond the dual SIM issues, the Galaxy S7 Edge was a great phone.

The phone arrived quickly and came in a plain white box with a charger (no headphones, but I didn't expect any). I almost returned it because it was labeled a ""Verizon"" iPhone, but I popped in my AT&T sim card and it worked like a charm (LTE worked too). The back of the phone was flawless, but I noticed some minor scratches on the screen. They are not noticeable when the screen is on, so it doesn't bother me. Plus I knew I was getting a refurbished phone and not a brand new one, so the scratches didn't surprise me too much. The battery life on the phone so far is fantastic. I am able to go two days without charging my phone. I was worried about the battery being in poor shape, but it is working great. If you're on the fence about buying one of these certified refurbished phones, I say go for it. The price is great. Just don't expect a spotless phone. Anyone who looks at my iPhone does not notice the scratches and thinks it is brand new. It is only when you get up really close and examine the screen that you notice minor scratches.",40.0,4
BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - White,BLU,125.99,3,"I had bought 2 blu life one and 1 blu vivo air.. I gave the vivo to my mom, and the life ones to my dad and little brother because they absolutely loved them..so I had to get myself a new phone and I decided to get another blu since the excellent experience I had with those other phones... well I chose this blue life xl because I thought it was the 2015 edition (which is not )...the delivery was very fast as always.. when I took it out of the box I was lightly disappointed because the screen had some lines like pixels with rainbow colors and if you watch the phone from different angles they're more notorious and the back cap seems to be made of hard paper? It was a pain in the ass to opened because I didn't wanna break it ... next I put the battery in and charged until it was 100%..turned it on and started to set my Google account and information... everything set up so let's start:The screen wallpaper was blurry,but was OK.I downloaded all my apps and didn't run out of space..Put my 8gb sd card in to try the sound and the video reproducer ..the sound isn't great but is good and is better if you use headphones (not the ones that come in the box) ..I liked the big screen because you can watch videos and movies and the poor definition of the screen is not a problem there...Next thing I tried was the camera which I don't use so much...the rear camera is OK, take nice and clear pics, but the front camera sucks I took a few selfies and my face looked blurry...The battery life is great for how much I use my phone... check Facebook, instagram, snapchat etc.send a couple texts and make a couple calls of 5 mins and I got 70% of battery by the end of the day so I don't have to worry to leave the phone charging overnight I can charge it in the morning in 30 mins ...well now I put the sim card in ( I hate that I had to turn off the phone and take out the battery ) and it automatically recognised T-Mobile..but surprise it didn't support 4g?? Only 3g but that wasn't a problem for how much data I use..Well overall the things I didn't like about the phone we're:The screen is freaking hard to use, you have to push the screen several yes in order to open an app or when typing.. the definition is very poor..I couldn't turn turn the brightness down.. it always went back to high...Didn't save some default changes like the auto corrector keeps turning on...The camera sucks...I was going to return it but my sister came over this summer to celebrate His sons bday so I thought this would be a great present for a 10 years old.. and yes it was he totally loved it he plays games all day and watch movies in it.. so this phone was a great deal after all but Isnt good for a teenager or adult that use it for texting or social medial... but for $130 is a good deal",1.0,4

This looked like my solution. So I dove in. I receive the phone faster than I thought which was the only positive thing about this order but i did pay for faster shipping. The day of the birthday the gift was opened. It was very impressive looking. Looked similar to the Galaxy Note 2. It came with two batteries, a charger, a memory chip for the phone, head phones, ect basically everything that it said was gone come with it. Which gave the impression I paid way more. After turning on the phone and playing on it I started to notice a few problem.Apps that came with the phone crash. I tried to install a few things like facebook and candy crush and they both would go to the load screen and crash as well. Facebook would only run after like 8 attempts. I figured the phone just needed to be rested and so i tried that. Nothing changed expect the fact that I couldnt get facebook to run at all now.The batteries after being charged fully would only give me 3-4 hours of usage out of them at mid power on the phone and not at constant use either.Compatability with service providers sucked. I tried family mobile (tmobile generic brand), tmobile, and at&t. I would only get the G network and barely any signal.Internet wifi and without- Ok without wifi the internet was so slow that it would literally take minutes to load a single webpage. With wifi I was lucky with 10 second load times. It average at 10-15 seconds and my wifi supports speeds up to 24mbps.I tried going to trya few places to get service and I was told that with it being a foreign phone they couldn't help me. I took this time to write this review so others wouldn't have the same experience and waste they time and money. The phone looks cool but is essentially worthless. Unless ur sole purpose is to have a phone that has iffy call quality and to look cool doing it then this isn't a good choice at all.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",0.0,0

But, while I tried the initial configuration of the phone, it did not proceed after connecting to the internet saying ""Unfortunately Setup Wizard has stopped working"". While I tried hard restarting the phone, it shows as **Locked**, which seems to be false advertisement in my opinion.Amazon, please help in either refunding or replacing the device. I like shopping in Amazon, but am really disappointed with my ""Black Friday"" experience.Saubhik ChatterjeeUpdate: I gave it another try yesterday night, and the configuration were successful some minor tweaks here and there. Apologies if I caused any problem to anyone. The phone is working absolutely fine now, and love the phone. Again, the phone is amazing. Thank you Amazon.",1.0,4

"Samsung Galaxy S Duos II GT-S7582 Factory Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, White",,280.0,5,We got this phone for use in Europe with an international SIM card. The phone worked great with the SIM card and we were able to receive calls everyone in Europe. It has the quad frequency required by most countries. Call clarity was good and the camera takes good pictures. It has many apps already installed - most of them are nice to have but not necessary. We did not use data much in Europe as we were on a cruise and spent time in London using Tube and Bus. Everything is pretty well marked so GPS and other nice apps were not required. The phone has many options and you can make it a secure as you desire. It is small enough to fit snugly is most any pocket. I was concerned about the size because of some previous comments. I found it large enough to use with my big hands but yet compact enough to secure it against possible theft. I also have to say it worked very well with my hearing aid - something that not all phones do well. I am very happy with the phone and plan to use it when we travel later this year. We also use it to call Sri Lanka from the US because the call quality is great and the rates with our SIM are better than our local phone or our US cell phone with ATT.,63.0,4

The problem with that is that Nokia's one year limited US warranty applies only to US phones. You may not know this until you try to get warranty repair service, as other reviewers here have noted. But a call to Nokia with the IEMI number will tell whether you have a US phone or not.Amazon is aware that shipped phones routinely don't match the description, and won't do anything about it.

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,467.73,4,"Purchased on February, now reviewing during August.The Sony Z5 Compact is a great little device with plenty of powerful features.Specs:2GB ramQualcomm Snapdragon 81023 MP Back Camera (wow!)5 MP Front CameraMicro USB Charging Port4.6 inch Touch Screen DisplayIP 68 Waterproof, Dust proof, etc.Micro SD and Nano SIm card slotsReview:Wow!, I'm surprised Sony was able to compact their larger Z5 into such a small body that is convenient for your pocket and your hand. It is truly some remarkable engineering. Well, that compact size does have a drawback that may put some people off which is that it is a blocky/bulky phone. Even though it is a blocky/bulky phone, I always managed to get a nice firm grip because of the size and bulk of the phone. The screen size is perfect in my opinion for the size of this phone which is the same screen size for the iPhone 6/6s. The phone is also waterproof and dustproof which was sort of a minor, yet surprising, thing that Sony would usually put on their phones that is beginning to be used by other phone companies such as Samsung. The Camera packs 23 MP which is quite surprising for the size of the phone. The camera takes good pictures and good videos, HOWEVER, in only good lighting. If you take pictures in the dark, It will appear murky and pixelated. The phone's software experience has been vastly improved from its early beginnings and has lost almost all of its setbacks it had when it started. Sony's android skin is fast and simple, offering a near stock Android Marshmallow experience. The Speakers produce good sound but are located in the most convenient location that most phone companies ignore. The speakers are located in the front with one on top near the camera and one on the bottom. This means you don't cover the speakers when ever you're watching a video in landscape. Most companies put the speakers at the bottom of the phone next to the Micro USB charging port. The biggest grip of the phone is the processor that is encased in it which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. This CPU has a well known record of producing more heat than most of other CPUs in the market. This CPU is very powerful and still relevant even with Qualcomm's new CPU the Snapdragon 820, but it just gets hot very quickly. The heat isn't hot to the touch where it is unbearable it just gets warm when gaming, browsing the web, watching videos, etc. The battery life on this phone is great and it usually has enough charge to last me for a whole day and some the day afterwards. This is, However, if you utilize Sony's STAMINA Battery saver feature. You can still get a whole days worth without it, but you will probably have to cut back on CPU intensive tasks. Overall, this phone offers the strength and speed of its older counterpart(Z5) in a neat little package that doesn't make it uncomfortable in the pocket.Pros:Speed and power( CPU).Small and convenient package.Great front and back cameras.Great battery life.Speaker location is very good and sound great.Waterproof.Cons:CPU gets warm very quicklyCamera quality isn't very good in low light conditions.The thickness of the phone may put off some people.Will Update if necessary.",0.0,4

BLU Studio C 5+5 Smartphone with Lollipop OS- US GSM Unlocked - Gold,BLU,249.99,5,"I am a Georgia Resident (USA) and T-mobile User.. I am tired of paying ridiculous prices for new phones and having them break all the time. Warranty is too expensive and only cover a couple of times. And half the time buying an older or used phone it ends up having something bad that I didn't know until long time use or it dies on you. So I though I would give this a try. The quality of these phones are actually decent and they work really well. They do not have the Bloatware (T-mobile apps, AT&T Apps, Verizon Apps, Etc) that most phones and thus makes it seem fairly fast. Long time I am not sure how long these will last but at a range of $200 or $300 for some, it is not life or death if they fall and break as compared to those $600-700 phones that you get in the store. This one in particular made it good for the screen size, similar to my S6 Edge. The only difference is quality in screen but it is still fairly different. If you are trying to the latest phone, at half the price, just compare the specs of these phones (RAM, PROCESSOR, STORAGE, BATTERY SIZE, ETC.)",1.0,3

"LG Google Nexus 5 D821 32GB, 8MP, KitKat, Quad-Core Factory Unlocked - Red - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty",LG,455.0,5,"Of all the smartphones I have ever owned, the Nexus 5 definitely is at the top of the list. The phone has a sleek design and it feels great in your hand, with or without a case! I have owned this phone for about six months now and I still love it as much as the first day when I took it out of the box! It still performs great and keeps up very well thanks to it's Snapdragon 800 Quad-core processor. I have only had issues with the phone on an application side when a specific application freezes or doesn't meet expectations.The camera on this phone performs amazingly when there is great lighting and takes some really nice pictures thanks to the HDR+ mode. Like most other cameras, however night time images come out grainy, sadly those pictures are not up to par with other smartphone cameras in the market. Give it great lighting and it produces some really astonishing images for a phone.Google Now really pushes this phone to what smartphones can do with its constant reminders, traffic updates, interests on the internet based off of your search results an voice recognition. By saying ""Okay Google..."" you have access to the entire internet and the applications on your phone by voice command. If you're not using it yet, START!I highly recommend this phone over any other android phone just because of it's clean Android feel. Plus buying it direct from Amazon rather than through your carrier ensures you don't have all those bulky applications that you can't remove!This phone is slightly bigger than my last phone coming in at 4.95 inches vs. my last phone at 3.5 inches. Overall it is slightly bigger and as a female, I already knew it wasn't going to fit in any of my pockets (does fit in my back pocket, just not my front pockets). But I love the added screen real estate so I can't complain.Batter life out of the box is phenomenal and I have been getting two days of use out of one charge, much better than my previous phone. The drawback of the battery is that it is not replaceable but a portable charger works well with it.This phone also works with wireless charging which is really cool. I bought a wireless charger when I bought this phone and it works great. The drawback being that with a case (one that actually protects the phone) the locking positioning doesn't work as well.",,4

"Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803 16GB 4G LTE 4.6"" Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Black - International Version No Warranty",,244.0,4,"It's a cheap; great phone. It has in my opinion some good bloatware I would personally use: Lifelog, PlayStationApp, PlayStation Videos, album, etc. The camera is amazing; Xperia has some of the best camera filters and resolution overall as expected since the cameras are from Sony. The Android Lollipop OS runs smooth on the phone and overall haven't had any problems from crashing, lag, etc. The phone does have some overheating problems, not always but the Z3 can overheat at some points, but for a small Compact phone with powerful hardware, it's a pass for me (up to you). I've washed my phone, no problem, which is another plus. What I really like from the xperia is the GPS. Not every phone comes with the ability to use the GPS offline without using any 4g or 3g data. Another plus is the WiFi chip, Xperia supports 5ghz routers and 2.4ghz routers. Overall, the price makes it a very economical phone, averaging from $350-450. There is much more I can say such as the specs, the specs are amazing and the phone is really small, a bit fatter than an iPod touch. The only downer is the overheating. The screen is nice and shiny it still looks new and doesn't have a scratch or dent yet. I wish it could have been 64bit and included an anti-fingerprint screen, but overall I'm satisfied.",1.0,4

The camera took nice pictures too. And it also comes with 2 cases and also a screen protector. So no need to buy one, I didn't know this so I plan on returning everything I purchased for this phone.Now here's the BAD. Even though it felt like a premium phone, right off the bat I noticed a small area where the AMOLED screen was not glued to the gorilla glass 3 leaving a empty space making that spot look white. With the screen on you can't see it but with the screen off it stuck out like a sore thumb. Another thing is there is no app drawer but whatever. And finally when I put my Sim card in and tried to set my APN in network settings, the option to select networks was there but wasn't highlighted so my clicks did nothing. I couldn't setup the phone and data. Just wifi only.Needless to say I repackaged it and had it ready to return for a refund less than an hour of receiving the phone.

I am over making payments to a device that needs warranties and all sorts of addons so an Android phone in the range of $50-$150 seems reasonable.I looked into EVERY brand from Nokia, LG, Motorola, Chinese brands, and finally the American company BLU. To be honest, I was trying to avoid BLU. I felt as if since it were an American manufacturer supported heavily by Amazon that there was some sort of catch. A lot of reviews I read for other BLU devices also scared me by talking about OS malfunctions and poor performance. This is the only BLU phone with excellent reviews across the board in my budget range.Here's my thoughts so far. The device looks fantastic and runs the latest version of Android, which isn't terrible coming from a long time iOS user. I will say that the hardware in this 5"" phone makes it operate smoothly. With an extra gigabyte of RAM it could be even better but being that its a sub $100 phone it's great! I spent the first few minutes uninstalling the Amazon Apps (obvious partnership) and configuring the settings to my liking.PRO:- 5"" display with good resolution and OK brightness- Smooth interface with little lag or freezing- Lightweight- Acceptable placement of volume and power buttons, although I think there are better places to put them- Dual SIM for both personal and business lines which can have different ringtone settings for each.- Excellent Bluetooth connectivity- Comes with a case and screen protector as well as the standard charging accessories. All quality material.CON:- Battery life is not to my liking. I fixed this by keeping the phone on a lower brightness setting. It seems this is the major cause of battery loss.- Needs an aftermarket APP for the camera. The default camera app is OK but the image quality is fairly low even in optimal light. An aftermarket APP made this problem go away and luckily can be set as the ""default"" so the better APP can be launched from the lock screen.- Notifications: This phone likes to tell you everything it's thinking about. It alerts you every time it drops a percentage down of battery from 10% to 1%. I couldn't find anywhere on the web or within the phone settings to stop notifying me. Not a huge con but more of an annoyance.Conclusion:I'm a person who needs a phone for calls, texting, email and the occasional web browsing. I'm not too sure if this is the phone for games and tons of use but this phone is fantastic at it's price point. I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a cost effective smartphone.",14.0,4

Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Red,Nokia,149.35,4,"I purchased this phone because I was under the impression that it supported the 4G bands necessary to run on T-mobile with data.I received the phone and set up the T-mobile Sim along with the phones set up. So far so good everything working and it was fast!Then after everything was set up I decided to download apps and update the phone, I then enabled WIFI to speed up the process. After the updates and downloads I turned off WIFI to test the speed of the network. Now with my old phone I get 4G speeds ""not LTE"" at my house so I was expected the same speed or better. Then I saw in the top left corner it was full bars with a little G next to it which made me exited because I thought the G meant 3g or 4g. But it turns out that G means the step down from Edge. So when I tried using the browser my phone just sat there and gave up before it loaded even Google. And after some more research I found out that the data would only work on T-mobiles ""reformed"" networks which are only available in 49 cities.But, for my experience with the phone.Pro- Nice size, has some heft to it, it doesn't have that cheep feel to it, The screen size is not to small perfect if you have trouble with seeing the small screen of an IPhone. It's also fast the UI (User Interface) works well. Call quality is superb and the speakers are loud, but they are loud enough to hear if it's sitting on a table in front of you. And the camera is what you expect very good with the duel flash.Cons- The lock button is in a awkward place between the camera and volume rocker, you will find your self changing the volume long before you unlock the phone. If you like having a lot of information at a glace while the device is still locked you will be a little disappointed by the customization. Also if you like having a lot of live tiles at the top for you to see you will run into a problem that you can only fit around 4-5 live tiles with out making them tiny before you have to scroll to see the information. Also a side note, when it's charging and you use the phone the battery gets really hot.Other than a couple little complains the phone seems good, but i only could look at it use it a couple times before I decided I wanted to use data on my smart phone. If it worked with my provider I would have kept the phone and strongly recommend this phone to people who want a phone that works well and doesn't have the distractions of messing with every setting in the world before it works perfectly.",1.0,4

I have tried everything: rebooting the phone, factory reset, etc. (And, yes, the phone was always running the stock Asus firmware - never rooted - never flashed.) Same thing when I create a wifi hotspot from the phone: other devices can't see it. This makes me thing this is a hardware problem related to the wifi chip and/or wifi antenna.I am going to try to contact the vendor, but this will probably be impossible to get a return because the vendor explicitly disclaimed US warranty (""International Version No Warranty"").",3.0,0

It was as if life was going in slow motion as I watched my brand new Lg g3， with NO case，fall through the crack and tumble down the elevator shaft!!This was from the third floor mind you! I thought my phone ☎ was ruined FOR SURE!! Furthermore， how in the HECK was I going to get to it!! It was now，more than likely, at the bottom of the elevator shaft?? My apt manager called the elevator company and they said they charged 150 USD to send a technician to come open the shaft to investigate!!! Hmmm! Should I pay the 150 USD only to find my LG G3 broken into pieces? Well， It was cheaper than buying a new phone ☎ and I was curious， so I went for it. When they opened up the elevator shaft my phone was laying there in 3 pieces. To my amazment，it was the battery，front piece and back of the phone and when I put them together the phone FIRED🔥RIGHT UP!!There was NOT A SCRATCHH on the glass!! There is a slight gash above the center piece on the top bezle but the angle and fact that it mainted its white paint make it barely noticeable!! Its still looks and works as if it were BRAND NEW!! If I had a case， I wouldn't have even gotten the scratch near the bezel. WHOOO! All of this just happened a little while ago， so Im still in shock!!

I can confirm it works on TMobile's Volte. It has a strong signal. I knew this the moment I put my Sims in and got a strong LTE signal in my living room. Prior phones struggle (even the S7edge). I have to say this might be my favorite phone so far. I don't play games. I will test one out to see how well it handles them. I mostly use my phone for texting, emails, a lot of work tasks. YouTube, plenty of browsing. It's & fast smooth. It feels as premium as the S7edge. The phone came with a back cover, grayish wood looking. Not too bad. I have long work days. The battery life is the best.it can last me a full day without charging. My usage varies from light to heavy depending on the day. I have always been a Motorola fan. I was using the moto g 4 plus over my s7edge because of the better signal (good phone). I feel bad that I spent so much on my Samsung and it just sits there. I prefer the less expensive phones for the strong signal. If Moto/Lenovo can keep putting out mid range phones this excellent. I might just but their products.

(Model#: L700 Silver)",Posh Mobile,114.99,2,"Made the move to ""Posh"" because my Blu Studio II 7.0 decided after 6 1/2 months it no longer wanted to power up. Well it did power up but the screen stayed black. Under warranty but never got around sending a .PDF of the receipt. Whatever... Firstly, didn't see the same benchmarks as another person stating as fast as an iPhone 6. Didn't rate as fast as an iPhone 5. Wasn't a deal breaker. It is light and slimmer than the Blu. While the description says it only compatible with 32GB microSD, started with 64 and moved to 128Gb. Both are seen and can move files. For how long I dunno but ""very happy."" plus plus the device isn't locked down to the point of not being able to move apps. My only quibble is the 1GB Ram, the phoneblet :) still works. Haven't used it to make calls - MetroPCS. 4G and LTE are much much faster than the previous Blu. Impressed. Install Epic Citadel and can run. One other thing, resolution was kind of wourshed out. My fix was to use ADW Launcher with Ubuntu theme. Clears up graphics. Doesn't appear Posh is going to update to Marshmallow and their website only lists a modded version of Lollipop. Overall very hsppy for now. Hopefully it will last longer than Blu - for me. 12-10-16 update... Left the above yada yada yada up ""just because."" The device (mine) is a glorified piece of junk. Sorry Posh Folks, it's true IMO. Noticed over a course of a few weeks that it was becoming progressively slower and slowwwwwer. Wasn't certain whether app updates did it and was too lazy to confirm. Chrome = Not responding OK or Wait. Actually, all apps received the dreaded ""Not responding."" Thankfully the Posh was to be used as a commute by train, possible backup phone device. Nixed it and went with an iPad Pro 12.9 with cellular and couldn't be happier. Minus the inability to make calls. Well, there are apps for that as well as FaceTime. Sooo, the Posh has been relegated as an XBMC remote and other. My guess is the low RAM certainly was playing a part. Could be wrong and so over trying to confirm.",5.0,1

Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,229.99,3,"I purchased the Mate 2 and received it on 06/26/2014. I love the device for the price of $299 but there were some things that I think should have been updated with this product being it is the face of Huawei in the US. First and most important it should have been updated to Kit Kat either out of the box or as an update once on Wi-Fi, this would have attracted more customers to the phone. Notification Reminder, when you receive a text or email they need to add an option to put a reminder. You get busy doing things and you would forget someone text you or you received an email so it would be nice to set a reminder like every 2 minutes. The phone does have a light indicator which blinks but they made it too small for a 6.1’ screen especially when you are outside and mine being a white color you cannot really tell in the sunlight areas. One other thing if your charging your phone the light will not blink if you get a text or email so that sucks, you have your phone on vibrate or mute you will not know you got a notification if it is charging because on vibrate it only vibrates once when you receive the notification. It has a feature that I like which is a pop up message, this is so you can do a quick reply to a text without stopping what you’re doing like surfing the web or watching a movie. The only issue with this feature is when you are texting back and forth and you’re on the text conversation you still get the pop up message, it would be nice if the phone determine when your already in the conversation it would not pop up I had an LG Optimus G Pro and It had this feature and it determined when I was in the text conversation. ONE MAJOR thing with this phone is the LCD screen, some customers out there are experiencing issues with when you tap the phone there is like flash in the background where you tapped, if you YouTube this phone you can see some videos which I posted one myself. I returned my Mate 2 because of this issue plus when I had a white background you can see a white spot in the LCD screen(it’s in my video). I will try another Mate 2 and see if it was just my phone and if not then Huawei needs to fix this ASAP, $299 is still allot of money for an average phone. Hope this Helps",4.0,0

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,1,I purchased this phone on 6/13/2013. Upon receiving this phone it was in good condition on the outside. Once i opened the phone the keypads were badly worn. Most of the buttons were flush with frame of the phone which would tell me it was used quite a bit. I also started to experience problems with my phone shutting off randomly. After i took the battery cover off the back of the phone i noticed it was not the battery pack that comes with the phone. It was loose just enough that it wasn't making the correct connection to the terminals. I put a small piece of paper to wedge the battery in so the connection could be made. That fixed that problem the the good condition used phone. In August of this year i started to have problems with sound on the phone. I had several people tell me they could not hear me unless i screamed into the phone. I later recorded my voice while speaking into the phone and there was no sound from my voice. I then realized i was sold a junk phone with excessive wear from the seller and lied to about his posting on amazon.com that this phone was in good condition. I have sense thrown the phone away and bought another from my cell phone provider. I would not recommend buying a phone from this seller.

The beats audio system produces the best audio with boom sound.I switched to HTC one from iphone 4s and I instantly fell in love with it . It gives you real luxury of having a smartphone it's 441ppi display, aluminium body are fabulous. Though I was skeptical about battery it lasted a whole day(8 am to 7pm) with good use of wifi,calls and music it lasted two hours more when compared to my iphone 4s for same usage. only thing which it misses is the headphones , they are not so good but serve the purpose......Lack of good publicity limited its sales hopefully HTC continues its work to build the best smartphones...",0.0,4

"BLU VIVO 5R Refresh Smartphone - 5.5-Inch Display 4G LTE GSM Unlocked, GOLD",BLU,197.92,5,"I ordered both a white and black version (for both me and my boyfriend). I previously had the Moto G4, but the port would no longer charge so I had to find a replacement ASAP. I absolutely LOVE this new phone! It feels like my old Iphone 6s Plus in my hands. The screen quality is beautiful, the back is NOT plastic, and it feels and looks like a very expensive phone (heavy in a good way). It plays games like Pokemon GO and RPGs very well. Loads multiple applications at once with out a problem. The fingerprint sensor is snappy and fast. Sound quality is loud and clear (make sure to take off the back sticker that is over the speaker!!!). I am very, very happy with these new phones.ALSO! I accidentally threw my phone across the room with all of my strength because I got tangled in the charging cable and didn't realize it was wrapped around my wrist. I ripped my blankets off very quickly and my phone went FLYING!!! Hit the wall and it landed on the hard wood floor. No scratches, nothing broken. Everything is fine.

BLU Advance 4.0L Unlocked Smartphone -US GSM - Pink,BLU,57.29,5,"Nice, small, inexpensive phone that does all that we need including usable to trip to Europe.Our top priority, so we can travel places, like Europe, is saving money. As another reviewer related about switching from the simple but dinosaurish now in appearance flip phone(""You still use a Clam shell?!"" ""Yes, and I love it, now leave me alone!""), the time had come to switch(now that phones and phone plans have greatly come down in price- except I-Phones), but we wanted to do it as cheap as possible.Thanks to that reviewer's recommendation, we tried PureTalkUSA (ATT GSM network, Cheap plans, no contracts, great customer service) and a pair of BLU phones. We like the compact size, ease of use and low cost. It works and is saving us money. We have no complaints because we started at the ground level with only the desire to communicate and save money, Mission accomplished with smart phone perks.Of note: it holds two full sized SIM cards that go in sideways, one on top and a small, metal tray that pulls out underneath for the second one(See photo nicely given by another reviewer who used a smaller SIM card and tape. PTUSA gave us all sizes compatible inserts with their SIM Cards).",1.0,4

Nokia Lumia 635 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8.1 Quad-Core Phone - White,Nokia,99.95,5,"Initially I ordered this phone for my mother in law, but I ended up using it myself. She wasn't too keen switching from iOS to Windows.The phone came brand new sealed in a box and it has no AT&T logo (upon boot or on the case anywhere) and it worked flawlessly as soon as I put the sim card in.I was previously using an iPhone 5s before I switched to this bad boy.This phone can do as much as any other smart phone (even if it's not high end). I'm a heavy phone user (specially call and email) and the battery still lasted about 2 days.Pros:- LTE works flawlessly (I'm using AT&T)- Emails were quite easy to configure (similar to the iOS)- Love how you can associate an image with a contact and it pops it up on the screen along w/ the caller's information (name, phone nr, etc). I know this is a feature on the iOS too, but, I like this one better.- Long lasting battery- Fluidity between switching apps- Good microphone, speaker and camera- Decent size / big screen- Cortana is a great feature. I've been using the iPhone for a long time and I have never used Siri. But Cortana is a different story- Has all the necessary apps (I am unsure why some people complain, because I found all the apps I was previously using on the iOS).Cons:- Gmail is a bit slower than the other emails, but that's fine- Not powerful enough to run Windows 10 (I installed the preview build for a few hours and then reverted back to 8.1)Truthfully this is a very reliable phone. It may not have a frontal camera, or an extremely expensive screen, but it does the job.Microsoft stepped up their game and I personally think that Windows Phone is and will be a serious competitor against Android and iOS.In a few words, I love it and I am going to stick with it.",0.0,4

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - White - 16 GB - Unlocked,,149.0,5,"One year ago I was scared and angry as my brand new lg g3 landed on my cereal bowl and shattered. The LCD screen and digitizer were completely destroyed. I tried to plead with Verizon but to no avail as they wanted me to pay 250 and I even contacted LG themselves and their response was mutual they wanted 100s to fix the phone due to self negligence. I had no ideal what to do I'm just some poor college kid who was dependent on my smartphone. The only phone I had laying around was the Nokia 8855 which was so old that even my grandpa didn't want to use it anymore and the moto g 1st gen. I knew nothing about the product line at the time as I always used an Lg phone or galaxy. But my oh my that phone was something special. Never did I expect to use it so long as it’s been great phone and surpassed my expectations. But I’m at the point now when I wanted something new but still cheap as my two contract still has not expired and will not till November. 5.1 Lollypop was the last update to come to that phone and no gyroscope which means no google cardboard. I I researched for days and days and on everyone's list the moto g play was on their for a great budget phone coming soon. I was surprised it only had 2 gb of ram and a snapdragon 420 or something how could this thing even handle android marshmallow which critics everywhere say needs at least 2gb of ram to function? Anyway as previous moto g owner I knew of the awesomeness that is the moto g and this phone looked like the true spiritual successor as Lenovo has been moving away from the design and price point since the g3. So I didn't have any more time to waste I went to ebay but it was not there unfortunately as this is a new phone. Luckily I knew someone who has connections and I was able to secure an early copy of the device. Anyway their has and never will be a phone that compares to the moto g 1st gen but this comes close. On ebay you can buy a very functional moto g first gen but this phone is much better and is a proper successor. Surprisingly it's smoother than some modern phones out there like at one point I had a galaxy s5 I'm sure this thing was more snappy than that. Touchwiz back then was a joke I know not any more but it was. Please don't let specs or benchmarks judge this phone you need real life application that's simply the only way to see the greatness that is this phone. It runs most apps perfectly even heavy games like NBA Jam and Asphalt 8 runs fine and can maintain a good frame rate. To be honest it loads web pages very fast even on data. It comes with very little bloatware as Motorola has always embraced a close to stock experience with their products. The only true downside I could say the moto g play is the root ability. They really don't want you to root this thing kingo and king root don't work, stump and towel have a similar fate you really have to know what you're doing before trying to root this thing and before I forget the lack of sd card ability of the original moto g is finally gone so that’s nice. The camera is pretty decent to 8MP front facing camera will get the job done with light. At night it’s not as good but still good enough you still have that weird pixel effect when it’s dark. But overall for the price of an expensive meal you will have a functional smartphone that at times will beat your flagship in certain processes. I love this phone and the original it saved my arse. As this nightmare lg g3 contract finally ends in November I look back on this time and think it was not that bad the moto g 1st gen and moto g play are good phones. Don't spend 700 on a new phone or 200 to fix it use. This phone is the new holy grail of all android value phones it's a masterpiece and a technical marvel. Seeing the Moto G4 makes me sad as Lenovo is abandoning what made the moto series so legendary. I hope one day the realize their mistakes before it's too late. In short this phone is the great but nothing compares to the moto g 1st gen.",54.0,4

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,578.0,4,"My daughter broke her current cell phone so I took the opportunity to upgrade my Nexus 5 (16GB) to Nexus 5X (32GB) this week and gave her my old Nexus 5. The transfer of information was super easy and quick from one phone to the other and I had almost all the apps I had on my old phone instantly added to my new one. Even my background was the same.I went with the 32GB because I was having to find space on my 16GB, so I'm really happy with the upgrade. I really like the Nexus phones and love that I get the android updates first and don't have to worry about compatibility with whatever network my phone is on. Those are both huge perks to me.I've only used the phone for the weekend so far, but I love the new fingerprint technology. Keeps my kids and others from getting in my phone without my permission. The new camera is nice, but I haven't used it much. I don't like that it sticks out the back of the camera in the way that it does, it looks a little ugly and would probably be annoying if I didn't have a case on it that eliminates the way it protrudes out the back.It's fast. The battery seems to last longer than the Nexus 5 ever did, but still isn't superb compared to other brands.The only real complaint I have is with the new charger type. The type C charger is difficult to find. The one provided by LG is only 3 ft, which is not long enough. I knew going in with a new charger type, that I would need some new cables so I purchased several off amazon when I bought the phone. A car charger and two 6 ft cords.First, I used the included LG charger. I didn't realize it would be a type C to type C cord. Meaning instead of a USB on one end, it had a type C plug on both ends. Okay...that means I can only use the cord with the provided wall charger but that's not a huge deal just an annoyance. Except the charger wouldn't stay IN the phone. It constantly shifted just slightly and stopped charging. No matter how much I tried to shove it into the phone it never seemed to easily 'catch' within the phone like any previous charger I ever used. I don't get frustrated with things very easily but this quickly frustrated me. When it did work, it charged at a good rate but you pretty much couldn't touch it or it stopped charging.So I pulled out the two 6ft cords I bought, but they had USB ends and couldn't replace the type C end on the wall charger that came with the phones so I had to dig out other wall chargers. These type C chargers don't charge nearly as well as the LG phone but they stayed in the phone better than the LG. They were just super slow.So then I tried the car charger I got and it worked wonderfully. You could FEEL it catch unlike the other ones and it stayed in the phone without any issues. It charged rapidly and of 4 chargers I have for the phone, the car one is the best.So I sent myself on a mission to find more chargers locally and found it problematic. Best Buy only had a 3 ft cord--not long enough. Target's were sold out and I didn't see the size of what they did stock. Walmart had no idea what I was referring to when I said type C and had nothing in stock when we looked. They didn't carry it.Other than that I love the phone.",,4

Initial start up/boot was very slow but after use start up has become quicker. It is more than enough storage for me but does also have the option to add more or input a 2nd sim. Allows control over which sim you're using (can also use both) and which you incur data from, very neat. Upon initial camera use I was not satisfied due to having to adjust the settings manually (I am not a photographer and don't have much experience in this). After messing around with it a bit it does have pretty great picture quality. The fingerprint reader has not failed me once, successful on each attempt and I have 4 fingers uploaded (few days use, as well as purposefully shutting on/off to test this).Some things that have me iffy about keeping the phone (and I'm hoping someone reads this and can offer some input). Any white screens, such as the stock messaging app or going into settings, comes off very fuzzy for me. I'm still able to read the text and it's for the most part clear and crisp, it just looks fuzzy or more so like there is dust under the screen. When there are colours it is not so noticeable thus making it tolerable, but even for a phone costing 400 I expect the screen to be crisp and vibrant in all colours/hues, which this does not seem to be in a white themed setting.4/5 rating - top notch phone other than the fuz in white screens.",11.0,3

Motorola Moto G LTE- Factory Unlocked US Warranty (Black),,108.0,5,"I have been using this phone for three months now and it has been awesome. The screen is crisp, battery life is great, and it has LTE. Those three were the main attractive points of this phone and is why I purchased it. For me, LTE is a must and that is why I bought this older model instead of the newer one (which only has 3G). The only complaint I have about this phone is internal storage. It comes with 8 gb which is on the lower end for internal memory, but this was a quick fix with a micro SD card (which is something I would recommend to purchase as well if you are planning on downloading large apps or movies). While this phone lacks the features of a flagship device (amazing camera, faster processor, better screen, ect..) it does do an amazing job at retaining most of these features yet being a fraction of the cost. I would recommend this device to anyone looking for a great value phone to use for a prepaid plan.Currently using this with the $30 a month T Mobile plan: 100 talk, Unlimited Texting, Unlimited data (first 5gb 4G LTE)Pros:-HD screen (720p) (329ppi)-LTE (a must have for assurance of a future proof phone)-Battery-Doesn't feel cheap-PRICE-Unlocked phoneCons:-Internal storage (easy fix with a micro SD card)",2.0,4

BLU LIFE ONE X2 - 4G LTE Unlocked Smartphone - 16GB+2GB RAM - Grey,,149.99,5,"I have been looking for a new phone now for about 3 years. I've been living with a 2012 HTC One S. It's a pretty rare phone with very bad design. I wanted to upgrade to something that was very Vanilla. I wanted a Nexus but with the cost of the Pixel and Pixel XL I just couldn't see a reason to buy one this year. But, my old phone got to a point where it was just time to buy something, anything new.My coworker caught wind of this phone a few weeks before it released. I missed the $179 sale but didn't feel too bad about spending $200 on an unlocked phone.My experience, which is only about 2 weeks old, has been great.Let me start with the drawbacks.1) This does not have NFC. I was a bit sad about that. But, when it comes down to it I think I'll live without it. I mean, the uptake on NFC payment hasn't been stellar yet.2) There are two speaker ports on the bottom. I only get sound from one. I thought about returning and replacing. Frankly, it's a phone. It wouldn't sound better with 2 speakers.3) The lowest volume for the speaker is pretty loud. I can live with this too.The positives:1) The price for specs right now. 4 GB RAM with a relatively new SOC at $200. It's nice to not break the bank for an octa-core phone.2) The screen is very nice. Very bright. And the glass is very smooth.3) The battery lasts me all day. Even if I play some light puzzle games (Futurama for now). The second day I had more charge than the first day. I think yesterday I went to bed and had 48% even playing games. The day before was about the same.4) Quick Charge 3.0 is great. I once went from 30% to 80% in about 10 minutes. I'll be ordering more chargers soon.5) Excellent antenna. My workplace eats cell signals (and battery). This phone has excellent reception in most places throughout the building.6) Excellent location/GPS. This could be by contrast. My old phone would sometimes take 30 minutes to find a GPS signal. I get some idea of my location withing a few seconds most of the time.7) Speakers. I know that I said only one works. But it works very well for a phone. I mean, I'm never going to use this as my primary video player. But, speakerphone is far more clear than I've dealt with (even on my wife's Nexus from a few years back).8) It has a plain old radio. It requires headphones for an antenna. But, they put some of those in the box. I have not listened to the headphones yet so I cannot comment on quality. They look well made and have a microphone built in.9) Very low on bloatware. BLU includes some Amazon software pre-installed. An app for warranty and a launcher. That's about it.I could probably think of more. In short, this is a pretty good phone, for my purposes, for $200. I very much like it.",11.0,4

I'm not dropping it from 5ft let alone 1 inch, I'm simply shutting the phone as you have to with flip phones!

The price makes is right for a phone that fits the bill and gets the job done. I bought an unlocked model because I travel internationally and it allows me to use a GSM SIM card from both US and foreign national cell service providers.

HTC Desire 610 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android 4.4 Smartphone - Black (No Warranty),HTC,163.87,1,"Beware of missing information. I was looking forward to my first Android phone and what I received was a big disappointment.1. The write up about the HTC was very interesting at the capabilities. The memory cards being on the outside of the phone was not something I would prefer but I thought I could work with that.2. I kept reading and found that the battery is not user friendly, hidden away in a sealed compartment. The phone does not have a replaceable battery but I thought I could work with that.3. The memory cards; (this is from the HTC manual that I finally found after several hours of searching the web) ""Open the plastic slot cover with your thumb or finger insert nano SIM card until it clicks."" There is no click and no sound or feeling a click. Same story for the microSD card. But one thing more, never heard of doing this, ""Unmount the microSD card"". ""Slide the plastic hinge into the side and press the cover until it clicks into place."" A hinge folds or swings, it does not slide. It is on a very thin plastic hinge so it folds over the slot. I could see that breaking off very soon.4. The working phone itself is not bad, a little confusing, but not bad. I had been reading the manual before the phone came but it is not one I would have written because it leaves out information (I have written several manuals during my engineering career). No mention of the memory card sizes through out the manual. Does give a decent job of how to put the cards into the phone with pictures included. The software is similar to Windows 8.1 phone, which I have, with the sliding screens only they call them ""widget panels"". I did not get into them but to know that the phone comes with two and you can set up others.5. Interesting stuff: Transferring your old information was easy and painless until I went to find it. Google Drive integration. This phone is all about Google. On the home page is an icon that is GOOGLE. You press it and you go into the Google app store. The HTC phone is all about using ""Two-finger swipe"" and ""Three-finger swipe"", ""makes the three-finger gesture work only"" is from the manual. I rarely use my fingers, my fingers are too oily puts a film on the screen. I use a stylus with a rubber tip and did not have any problems working the apps or switching between panels. I take screen caps on my Windows Phone and wondered it the HTC does too. I did not find it until now. The process is similar, ""Press and hold POWER and VOLUME DOWN at the same time"".6. Now the bad stuff. I would give this a ""minus ONE STAR"" IF I COULD. The HTC did not come with the nano-SIM card. The phone can not be ATT activated with out the nano-SIM card. I sent an email to the seller, requesting the nano-SIM card. They told me, ""if you look at the listing, ""'it says it does not come with a sim card'"". I did, four times, and there is no mention of any sim card, including or not including the card in the package. After telling them that then they said, ""if it does not mention the sim-card it will not come"".That is to say if the seller does not say, ""the HTC does not include the memory (nano/SD) cards"" then they will not be part of the shipment. The power cord is not mentioned either but that is included.The HTC phone has a label on the back that has the IMEI numbers and a note from ATT that says, """"Current AT&T customers:"" and above the IMEI label it says, ""new SIM included in the package"". The saving grace of this is that I went to the ATT site and put in the IMEI number and ATT would send me a nano sim, Free, to activate the phone. That would have been ok except I paid for the nano sim card that every phone comes with, my Windows Phone did and I activated it in two hours. The individual was arguing through the email about not sending out the card.You wasting time and money if you buy this phone because of the sim card.",4.0,0

(curiously, the warranty was 90 days.) first, it stopped keeping time. then every time i received a call, it would switch into another function so that the call ended up on voicemail. thinking that it might have needed a software update, i tried to hook the phone up to nokia's pc suite. in the past hooking up took anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour: it never worked the first try. so i spent an hour and a half without any success. i tried the support system in the past never with success. i was able to find a way to send the phone back--i have extended warranty from amex. but even if my phone would be fixed, i would still need to buy a new phone for the interim; moreover, i had no reason to believe the problems would be remedied. instead, i decided to take out my frustration by badmouthing nokia every chance i get for the rest of my life. no wonder that every other cell phone company is taking share from incompetent nokia.",8.0,0

BLU Studio C 5+5 Smartphone with Lollipop OS- US GSM Unlocked - Orange,BLU,69.99,3,"I bought two of these phones because I wanted to surprise my friends, who were going away on a trip and both of them needed new phones. I looked at many different smart phones on here, specifically with 4G LTE, which in itself narrows the selection. This phone stood out to me. The price seemed ok, the specs sounded fine and the reviews were encouraging. So I bought two. I was excited about getting them, and giving them away but the joy of the surprise didn't last very long. Both phones have inaccurate sensors. If I tap a letter in the top row, it gives me language selection. I need four, sometimes five attempts to open an app because it doesn't respond to lighter touch. It becomes extremely annoying when you type a message and it frequently inserts a suggestion, just because you typed the letter slightly upward. Even for a budget phone like this one, I expected better adjustment. I also couldn't, like in my own phone, (which was the same price but seems a much better quality) calibrate the sensor to have a more accurate typing experience. There was no way to fix this.As I gave the two phones away, the frustration was high as I felt I had made a bad choice. I am returning at least one of them and have already ordered a phone of which I know that it works.There is some good about these phones however. The wifi is relatively fast and the phone itself is fast in opening apps for example. The screen is very clear and almost looks like a retina screen, very high quality. The colors are vibrant. This phone comes with a screen protector and a slim silicone case. All of that is absolutely great and I like that the sellers do sell a product with thought behind it. But all the good doesn't help if the one thing that makes a phone useable, being able to type or press on a symbol is not working well.",1.0,4
Palm Treo 750 Smartphone (AT&T),Palm,179.95,2,"I'm an attorney who has had this phone for almost one year (June 2007) and I'm ready to get rid of it. It does not play well with others. I had a palm for years which synced my calendar/to dos, etc. with my office. When palm switched to microsoft, the calendar only syncs from the desktop - all data entered on the phone is lost -- all the techs have said that I have to live with this -- not very realistic. It will not sync with my contacts list. It crashes about once or twice each week. My first one was completely broken when sent to me and the replacement has not been much better. It will suddenly not ring so I have missed calls and messages. The battery does not last long (I've turned off the email checking feature - when that was on, I received 3-4 hours of use, with it off, it must be recharged every 2 days -- if you forget and the noises are off to alert you to a low battery - you really lose!)

I'm just not buying the IPhone koolaid, having tried them a number of times, they don't excite me. I just wanted a practical high-tech phone at a good price (with no contract) and this seemed to be it. But it's not.Problem #1 is phone call quality using AT&T in the San Francisco Bay Area. Your experience with another carrier in another area may differ, but this phone could not effectively make a phone call. I'd dial out, get connected, and within seconds I'd lose the call, all while standing perfectly still. I'd receive a call, answer it, and within seconds the call was dropped, or it would be dropped while it was ringing. Out of a dozen calls that I made or received in the first day, I only had a satisfactory phone call 3 times. Of those 3 times, the person at the other end said that always, every time, the sound was horrible and they could barely understand me, though I heard them well. And just to prove that it is this phone, I took out the sim, put it into a cheap GSM phone I own, and I have great call quality, no dropped calls, and it works like a charm. It's the phone (perhaps in conjunction with AT&T, but other phones work).Problem #2 is dealing with WIFI. I set up the wifi connection for the wifi in my house, putting in the passcode (which stupidly you need to do with a phone-pad keyboard). Then I'd go to the web browser and it would be using AT&T. So, I found that there are 3(I think, maybe more) places you can set up this wifi connection, did them all, and somehow after quite a number of hours, I got it to use my wifi connection. But....a few minutes later, I tried it again, and it asked me for my passcode for that network. So I put it in again, laboriously. Then an hour later I tried again, and it couldn't see the wifi network, even though I was 5 feet from the wireless router. So, I turned off the phone, turned it back on again, and sure enough it finds the network, but it needs my passcode again. This is not convenient. In fact, it is not even usable. I was never able to get this phone to retain the passcode to my wireless network for any length of time more than a few minutes over 2 days of trying.The new phone I received needed to have it's software updated. I highly recommend you do that right away, as the new software is a vast improvement over the software that ships with the phone. That said, it takes a long time to update. And even though it is a vast improvement, the new software still has plenty of oddities, irrational quirks, and just plain weirdnesses that are too numerous to detail. Their software development team badly needs a consistency control department. Each application, or portion of an application works differently, with no consistency among them as to user interface and interaction. It's a frustrating experience. And although they improved the scrolling tremendously from the software in the device out of the box, it still isn't a good scrolling experience.The GPS was not nearly as accurate as my friends' IPhones. I don't know why but my friends' IPhoness get me standing in front of my house as just that, me standing in front of my house. This phone has me about 1/2 block down and across the street (or around the corner, or on the next street over). If GPS that is accurate to within 1 city block +/- is good enough for you, that's great, I don't think it will work for me.I've sent my phone back. I can tell after just a few days that I'll never be happy with this phone. It's a shame really, because by specification it is exactly what I want. It just doesn't work as specified.",3.0,2

"Nokia E71x Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 3.2 MP Camera and Dual-Band 3G (Black)",Nokia,59.99,1,"I tested for Nokia and loved their phones ... even tested their voice dial in 2005.I have had this 3 days, have NOT read the manual, but browsed it to find missing featuresThis beautiful phone needs 3-4 hours with the manual - then I will rewrite this review.I OFFER this to you and TO NOKIA as an ""OUT OF BOX USER EXPERIENCE"".When Nokia decided to save 1 day of developer/QA time they multiplied their CUSTOMER SUPPORT costs 1000 fold, and risk WAVES of customers migrating to iPhone, HTC, Android and even Motorola...I chose this unit because it was rated 4 1/2 stars and had a 2 year model run ... certainly ALL THE BUGS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WORKED OUT??PLUS: Read all the other reviews, the ""plusses"" are undeniable *AND* it's INACCURATE to call it ""GRAY"" ...it is silver/steel/iridescent ... solid, BEAUTIFUL !MINUS - right out of the BOX deal breakers! A. VOICE DIAL - FAILS AND RESETS / CRASHES PHONE ... I never read this in any review. SOLUTION: Many have reported this in Nokia's forum. The fix? NOT a software update! But Nokia's analyst Huddle offers this MOST EMBARRASSING fix. 1. ""Change language to Philipino (only Auto, English, Spanish and French on my phone, I chose Spanish) 2. Phone announces will restart and does 3. ""Change back to your language"" (I chose English not Automatic)... restart again 4. IT NO LONGER CRASHES, .... it has 30-40% accuracy and does NOT confirm which number of contact it will call. My much maligned Motorola models from E815 to Z9 had absolutely natural and accurate voice dial. The Nokia E71 has a robotic voice that starts dialing before you can find the STOP button in a panic.B. GPS - menu navigation is cumbersome, it bumps you from level 3 back up to level 1, and says SEVEN DAY TRIAL ... although this was NOT what I read here in Amazon before I bought it.C. Text Message In box not found ... I'll spend a day with the Manual and update this review3.9 STARS *if and only if* you commute by train and DO NOT DRIVE NOR NEED VOICE DIAL. The handy keyboard SACRIFICES dialing safety for EASE OF MESSAGING ... very critical for SAFETY1 1/2 stars or less if Nokia thinks SO POORLY of their customers to offer a CRASHING PHONE for the MOST BASIC function ... offer such an embarrassing fix ... What good is GPS, Barcode Reader (yes! 2D not the 1D simple stuff you see on retail labels), Wireless Keyboard interface, if it will not make a handsfree phone call in traffic when the technology has had 5+ years to be refined? Motorola and Nokia ought to swap engineers and MAKE THEM USE THEIR OWN PHONES before selling it. I'm mad because this phone has the beauty of a top-of-the-line-Audi or BMW, yet but leaves customers trying to look cool in the parking lot making vroom vroom noises when the key breaks in the ignition.",8.0,0

The included charger was clearly not OEM and what's even worse, is that the phone lost battery life, even while being charged using the non-OEM charging brick. I made sure that this wasn't a defect with the phone's battery by testing it's charging capabilities using a standard micro-usb cable plugged into one of my computer ports and again using the stock charger that came with my Galaxy S5.

CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Black Plus),CNPGD,59.99,3,"I loved the idea of having a smart watch. I've been looking for one for a while and i wasn't willing to pay $500 for the Samsung Gear. It didn't come with any directions per say so you just have to wing it on operation/ use/ set up. Of course is touch screen. It took me a little while to figure out that you can swipe through the main screens. When you want to dial out the numbers aren't all that easy to push so you may find yourself having to redail the numbers a few times. The volume is kind of low. I wish it was louder (so when driving i could hear the person clearer) however I've been told that i can be heard just fine. Playing music is fine since it connects right through my phone. It does not have a camera, you can't verbally write your text messages, and i still haven't completely figured out how to add numbers to the phone book. All in all its actually a pretty good watch for the price. Play around with the watch for awhile, you'll eventually love it. The inside of the band is completely Rubber and I don't sweat which is good. It looks exactly the same as it does in the pictures",0.0,2

BLU Selfie Global GSM - Unlocked (Blue),BLU,169.99,3,"Don't get me wrong, this is now a bad phone; It's just that there are BLU phones with more features, promised lollipop upgrades and cheaper price points out there.The premise for this phone is appreciated. It shares the same snapper that is included in the new BLU Life One which is an older model camera, but still takes great shots. The unit has a 4.7"" screen which is offset by a larger form factor which makes the device seem larger than competitors with like sized screens. The screen looks great and shows colors well with no graininess. The form factor is certainly comfortable in the hand due to the size, however, it is oddly rounded at top, bottom and back of phone. The power button is at top, Volume buttons on the left and a single camera shutter button on the right. If you have owned BLU devices before, this is odd as generally the buttons all reside on the right side of the phone. The charging port is angled and set to the far right of the bottom which makes for awkward placement when charging. Considering the price of the phone, $200+, one would expect there to be some pretty nice standout features, (i.e. Tap to wake) Here of which there are NONE.Note: The camera app has many great features as it should with a phone called ""Selfie""!There are other BLU devices out currently that employ a fantastic 8 Core Mediatek processor and great camera, (BLU Life 8XL, BLU Vivo Air) at a cheaper price. This is just a very bland phone for the price you pay.I certainly would recommend this phone at a price similar to BLU's other Flagship-like devices.",0.0,4

US market sucks cause they do not offer this, but its okay, you can use the unlocked Euro phone in US. Incredible flexibility and you can say bye bye to unwanted landline bills.CON: Major one is the battery life.. I use aps and its always being use so battery drains fast. I suggest getting an extender I am trying out Slim External Rechargeable Backup Battery Charger Charging Case Cover for Samsung Galaxy S4 mini with Pop-Out Kickstand (3000mAh) but have not yet tried it to review how much life extension it gives.

Initially, I loved this product for its smooth performance and 2-3 day battery life. Only issue I encountered was WiFi getting disabled after being idle for sometime. However, it didn't bother me much as I could manage it simply turning it off and back on. The customer support suggested to upgrade Android Kitkat to Lollipop which 'may' resolve the issue but I preferred not to. However, in the 5th month, a quarter inch wide strip of the touchscreen along the right edge stopped working and gradually the bottom strip of about same width also stopped working and that too when the phone has neither been subjected to dip in water nor did it experience any drop/damage. When contacted, the customer support again suggested the panacea to all problems viz., upgrade to Lollipop again. This time I upgraded but none of the issues were resolved, neither WiFi nor the touchscreen. Only change was faster drainage of battery and the user interface that I didn't like. And since it can't be downgraded I'm not stuck with Lollipop. Also as there is no warranty, so the product can't be repaired by Sony even after payment and I have been suggested to try local market which may not be reliable and affect waterproofing features!",0.0,3

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,4,"It's not a 5 star phone compared to all other phones. It's a 5 star phone based on combination of price and features. This no-contract phone at $190 (Amazon price on May 26 2012) is a great buy for the features it has.I bought this for my 12 year old as an upgrade to her non-smartphone and she's loving it. Has loaded bunches of games on it and hasn't had any trouble with any of them after about 10 days.The suggested retail for the Exhibit II is $330. At that price, it's actually a very poor value considering the Samsung GNex is now going for $400.Compared to the $150 (Amazon price) T-Mobile Prism, the Exhibit II is a far better phone.Jan 14 2013 edit: There is a Samsung Android update for this phone that rebrands the phone ""Galaxy Exhibit 4G"" (maybe some improvements/fixes in there too but I didn't look into the update). After nearly a year, the phone still works fine but she occasionally (maybe twice a month) experiences the homescreen icons vanishing (no lockups or crashes that I'm aware of) which is fixed by a reboot. The Galaxy Nexus (GNex) I mentioned in the 3rd paragraph is no longer available and has been replaced by the top of the line Nexus 4 at $299 (8Gb) or $349 (16Gb).Apr 3 2013 edit: Still operating fine with the notations from Jan 14 but I'm deducting 1 star because the ""value"" of the phone has gone down as it ages while the price remains pretty stable. The dual core LG Optimus L9 is now available with better specs at nearly the same price.

I knew the camera wouldn't be as great as my Lumia (RIP), I knew that this wasn't a top of the line phone or anything like that. However. I've only owned this thing for a couple of months and I'm already replacing it. The battery seems to be the issue. I usually just charge my phone before bed and leave it off all night but after not being woken up by my alarm one morning, I realized it was shutting itself off. So I have to keep it on the charger. If you look at the battery plotting, it's constantly draining and charging overnight and restarting itself. It wakes me up as it vibrates everytime it turns back on. I have to restart it when it's done because it'll say it has 0%. I DON'T EVEN KNOW.In addition, the keyboard is terrible. I have to type things out repeatedly and swiping for words is inconsistent at best and mostly doesn't work.

Samsung Galaxy S6 G920a 64GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Octa-Core Smartphone w/ 16MP Camera - White Pearl,Samsung,429.99,5,"So far I am very happy with this phone. I am planning to get an S7 Active once I can buy an unlocked version (they aren't available yet), but this is a nice upgrade in the meanwhile.Previously I was using an S5 Active. This S6 is faster and more efficient. Nice and thin/light, although I do use a case on it, so it takes away the nice slim and sleek appearance of the phone. 'Screen is beautiful. It takes great pictures and has plenty of camera settings .Very responsive to touch without any glitching and no need to tap multiple times for touch to register etc. Battery life has been surprisingly good, even with heavy use of internet, messaging, games, email, etc.I wasn't sure about using the thumbprint unlocking and account verification features, but it has worked flawlessly so far.The interface and layout is easy to navigate and find what you need/want. Getting to the settings to personalize things is pretty straightforward and just makes sense (the way things are categorized, etc). I was able to set mine up and have all the settings how I wanted them, in just a few minutes. I did go through and check everything out to see what differences there were from the layout on my S5 Active. There are some subtle changes, but not enough to make it difficult to figure out.I transferred everything from my old phone by using the quick connect feature, So much faster than bluetooth. It is almost instant. Made it so easy and saved so much time. Pics, videos, contacts, documents... everything, was faster and easier.Overall I am very happy with this phone. I haven't come across anything that I don't like or that is difficult, confusing, etc. If anything changes, i'll update.",3.0,4
"POSH MOBILE MICRO X, The Smallest Smartphone in the World, ANDROID UNLOCKED 2.4"" GSM SMARTPHONE with 2MP Camera and 4GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (MODEL#: S240 WHITE)",Posh Mobile,49.99,4,"I am a proud owner of the LG 320G phone since 2008ish. I like that it's not smart, lasts ages on a charge, and is very small. But everyone I know (all two or three of them) is like ""you need to respond to texts or else"", and on top of that it has started to malfunction.I caved recently and got this Posh Micro thing. I love it. It's even smaller, does everything a smartphone does, but is also too small for anyone to want to be glued to its screen. It's plasticky, but eh, it's also pretty inexpensive. Lasts longer than wife's iPhone on a charge, though not as long as my last phone.Kingroot worked no prob, though GravityBox took some trial and error, seems fine once I put it on the internal memory instead of SD card. The hardware seems sound. No interference in the audio jack. Fast enough.The Android install on it seems a little weird. It's the first I've used so I don't have anything to compare to, but a lot of things don't jive well with instructions on the internet. For example, the only way I can find to change the horrible default lock screen wallpaper (GravityBox doesn't work on this) is to press menu key on home screen and then desktop: not at all obvious. But the quirks are quickly learned, I guess.Edit: just want to report that I'm still very happy after a week. Sound quality is good, switching to small font was beneficial, and I got used to typing into the Google keyboard with my big hands. Battery lasts long if you don't play with it constantly, playing music doesn't affect batter much either. I realized it fits in that little mini pocket (for old fashioned watches) that jeans usually have within the normal right side pocket, nice! The hilariously small size of this thing seems more ideal the more I get used to it.I agree with the folks saying it's too bright; I used GravityBox to take minimum brightness down from default 20 to 4 (lower than 4 shuts of the screen), much more reasonable.Edit after a couple months: I'm sorry but as issues have turned up I'm singing a bit of a different tune, and lowering five stars to four. Like, don't love. I still have no interest in any other phone, but only because this is my only option in this size.One day the screen decided to have horizontal globs of dead pixels. Seems like a hardware problem as they're faintly visible with the screen off, however they change slightly every day, so I'm stumped.The vibration is damn near imperceptible through any clothing. Have this in your pocket for a while and you'll be more in touch with your otherwise ignorable spasms, because you'll be confusing them with the phone.USB connection is very flimsy at the phone side. It doesn't stay put, you have to really push and cram it in there till it starts charging, and then set it down carefully so that it stays connected.USB charger plug thingy emits a high pitched whine, just like most laptops of a decade ago. It's not severe, but enough that I keep it unplugged.OS issues: lots of small things. Can't change lock screen to anything beyond system defaults. Google keyboard reverts to Android keyboard on every boot, and sometimes on its own without boot. Sometimes when an app auto-updates, you get two icons for it, which show as the same in every other way, and uninstalling one uninstalls both.Like I said, I like it, but bummer about the problems. If this costed any more than fifty bucks these issues would earn it three stars.",17.0,3

I was pleased with many parts of this phone. However, hardware failures and a even worse experience with dealing with this customer service for warranty work leaves me wanting to list 0 stars. -5 stars.Within six months, the camera sensor died. Total failure. Call the warranty service department and find that I must ship the phone, at my own cost, to a service center for at least 21 businesses days. ( This means a month). When it is returned after a month, the camera works but now has a blue glow added in all pictures with a flash. Secondly, now I cannot talk on the handset because the ear speaker doesn't work anymore. Call warranty service again. They want me to pay to ship it to them for another month. I complained to manager , Cedric. He assured me that he would be personally finding me another solution within 24 hours. That was there days ago. No word, no email, no call.I owned this phone since March 2016, broke in September 2016, returned October 2016 broken, and will likely be sent back again and kept until December.They should sell this phone as a two pack because it breaks down and the service is so poor you will need to buy another phone to cover while it is being serviced.Bottom line: great phone until something breaks.

I have to say; buyer beware if you are after a certain color! :) These are DAY GLO bright. His orange phone, which looks nice and muted in the picture online, arrived as hunting-vest orange. It.. is.. so.. bright. My phone is more of a robin's egg blue, but that's OK. Fortunately my husband didn't mind is day-glo phone! His response was, ""Well, at least I can see where I put it.""For the hands-on usage... It's OK, but it has its quirks. For some reason, it hesitates what seems like forever after I select the ""text"" app and try to send a message. I have to continuously tap my finger on the ""type text message"" box to get it to respond.Hearing on it isn't the best; I have the in-call volume all the way up and sometimes have trouble hearing my calls unless I'm in a quiet area. If you're in an area any louder than a grocery store (or watching a movie for example), you may have some trouble. It has a great loud ringtone though!I wish I could completely turn off vibration. I still get a vibration when I receive a text or when the phone is in-call and it ""connects"" to the number you dialed; even though I have vibration and haptic feedback turned off. Strange. This might be user error, but their manual doesn't specify very clearly if there IS a way to completely turn off all vibration. I'm not too bothered by it as I'm just using this strictly as a mobile phone and not an entertainment device. If it goes off once in a while, I won't die. I don't have battery/space hog apps such as Facebook installed, so my battery life is very good. It can last two days before I have to charge it.The screen is hard to see sometimes. You have to angle it ""this way"" or ""that way"" depending on what you're trying to do.All in all, it's a solid phone and it's good for the price.

James here with Review This! Today I am reviewing the IPRO Unlocked Wave 4.0 cell phone.**Disclaimer** This is not a flagship killer phone. It is not the top of the line phone on the market. It is a budget phone. With that in mind, here is my review.Now that I have that out of the way, I want to say that I am very impressed with this phones quality for its price.I use a carrier that uses sim cards. So if I break my phone, I can simply take my sim card out and put it into this phone as a temporary replacement till I get my new one. It is only 3G capable, so don't get your hopes up of watching high definition videos while using your cell carrier.This phone has a slower processor, as well as slower gpu, so even though the battery is a small 1500Mah battery, it is plenty to last you all day. The screen size is perfect for smaller hands, and is very comfortable to use. This phone also feels very good to hold. It does feel a little cheap on the build quality, but for the price, I believe this phone is a steal. A computer in your pocket for under $40 with no contract! Nasa sent man to the moon with a room full of equipment that is only a fraction of the power this small phone has!It is running android, so you can access the play store for games and multimedia, the speaker in the phone actually sounds pretty good. So listening to movies or music is a delight.It is running a stock android. No bloatware, or unwanted apps to slow down the phone.This phone comes recommended by Review This! as a temporary replacement phone, a phone for a older person who does not need or want a whole lot, but still wants a smart phone(you can enable accessibility under settings to make it easier to read the screen), or for a kids first phone. This is a great value for the price!**I received this product at a discount or for free for an unbiased and honest review. I have reviewed this item honestly and thoroughly.

Using other applications like the Windows live messenger, ubersocial and facebook can diminish this time roughly to the half and maybe less.- Rebooting times takes forever, sometimes it takes over 7-10 mins!In another matters, the phone arrived at perfect conditions with all it's accessories.

They're unlocked only in the strictest sense of the word. These phones are branded - meaning they've got some carrier's logo on them - and more importantly, they've got a crippled version of the phone software.Now, the RAZR is a very cool phone. But, it's only as good as the software that makes it actually work. The AT&T software I had would not allow you to make separate profiles, and it required you to log on to ONLY the AT&T network to get ring tones, wallpaper, etc. All fine, if you're an AT&T customer - But this completely misses the point of buying an unlocked cell phone in the first place.I tried to fix the situation by ""reflashing"", i.e. putting on generic, useful software that comes with a truly ""unlocked"" phone (see e.g. [...]). As soon as I did that, the phone seized up, and demanded a ""Subsidy Password"". The phone really wasn't unlocked at all!If you want a phone that is truly unlocked and unbranded, buy it from one of the European Amazon sites. You'll spend a little more.

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone - 64 GB Retail Packaging - Gold,Apple,500.0,5,"This iPhone gives me nostalgia, but not because of it's ""retro"" design remembering the 5s. It feels nostalgic because 10 years ago I used to carry similar sized digital cameras to capture my life in photos.When smartphones became more powerful with better cameras I still waited because they still lagged in a few things and getting a small point and shoot was still a much better value for money.The SE makes the iPhone devices 'more affordable' and it is the smartphone that has finally convinced me to ""upgrade"" my portable photography philosophy to use it as my only camera for everything. The pictures are clear, beautiful, they are much better in low light than with point and shoot cameras, the camera app is super easy, and the shutter is fast fast fast. That was I was looking for.Speaking about software, wow what can I say that hasn't been told already? iOS is very fluid and minimalist, with no bloatware, something I appreciate A LOT. With Android, even with high end devices, you still feel some hicups and lag from time to time, but iOS is the king of ""smoothness"". I've even seen 5 years old iPhone devices working still like the first time.I don't care about the screen being smaller than other smartphones nowadays, because I don't watch much video on my phones, I'm minimalist so I just keep a few apps for messaging and photos and that's it.The battery life is great, but charging takes like 1.5 hours.Typing is something that will take me a few more days to get used to, coming from a 5 inches screen, but it is something I can live with.",14.0,4

Motorola Moto X (2nd Generation) - Black Leather - 16 GB (U.S. Warranty) Unlocked Phone,Motorola,109.0,1,"Let me preface this by saying that only 1.5 months ago, I really liked Motorola and loved my Moto X. Sadly, I cracked its screen, and even though I could fix it myself (I've done many phone repairs) I paid $130 to send it to Motorola for the original manufacturer parts and repair warranty. I figured I was paying for ease and convenience.I was so wrong.Almost two weeks passed without indication they had received my device. I called in a serious of support specialists before finally being forwarded to the escalation team, who took about 30 minutes to locate my phone, verify it had been received, and assue me that it would be sent back to me within 5 business days.But that wasn't the end.5 days later and no word from Motorola. I called again. Support informed me that, actually, they could not replace my Moto X. 'Replace' is the word they used. But wait - they are supposed to be repairing it, right? Wrong. Apparently they just send you a refurished edition of the same model. So they no longer had my original phone and could not even replace it with the same model.The representative offered me an 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6, which I absolutely HATE. It was way too big for me (I am a woman with small hands) and they are apparently completely unable to provide a Moto X Pure, which is the closest thing to what I have now. Somehow, it's not in stock? How is MOTOROLA, the company who MAKES the Moto X Pure supposed to be 'out of stock'?Anyway, they assured me the Nexus would ship in 5 business days. Here we are, 8 business days later, and STILL nothing. I called in at this point to demand a refund for all the inconvence, which I was informed they ""do not owe me"" because I agreed to receive a Nexus 6. Mind you, I agreed to a replacement for my LOST device - I did NOT agree that the replacement would be satisfactory compensation for all this grief and aggravation.This has been absolutely, by FAR, the worst customer service experience I have ever suffered through. On top of everything described, each representative could barely speak English, was dismissive and rude with me, and clearly barely trained, just reading off a script. I cannot express how enough how disappointed I am given how much I enjoyed the original product.At this point, I am only eager to receive my 'upgrade' to the Nexus 6 in order to promptly sell it, never buy anything Lenovo or Motorola again, and make it my life's mission to make sure everyone else knows how awful this company is, too.In sum, stay away from Motorola; while they make a decent product, should anything go wrong, God forbid, they will not support you and determine instead to make your life miserable.",2.0,0

Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - US GSM Unlocked Phone,Motorola,89.99,5,"I love my tech but I cannot afford the latest and greatest smart phone out there. Because of this, in the past 3-4 years, I have wasted money on numerous budget phones as well as older generation iPhone, Samsung and various other brands. None of them have left me pleased and I was more on the side of ""I am so frustrated with this slow phone!"" and ""You have got to be kidding me with this phone freezing all the time crap!""I decided to do some more research and found that the Motorola Moto E was recommended by several top rated review sites and mostly all customer reviews were outstanding. I purchased the phone and since it was only $30.00 more than the last phone that I purchased from another store, I figured why not, the Moto E couldn't possibly be worse than that dreadfully slow Centura that was my last catastrophe, err.. phone. I was correct and the Moto E has made me very, very happy. Straight Talk, my carrier, is even compatible with the phone and the setup was without any major complications. (I had to manually enter the APN info for Straight Talk to get the SMS & MMS to work correctly - But, I think that is more of a Straight Talk issue than the phone though).A major bonus for me is the signal I get compared to every other phone I have every owned where I currently live (rural area). I literally get 3 to 4 bars (4 being max) while the other phones would be 1 sometimes 2 and even no signal most of the time like I had with the Centura.With the 1GB RAM, I can actually answer an incoming call while playing a full screen game, WITHOUT the phone bogging down so much that it would prevent me from answering the call, like with some of the other phones I have owned. This phone has yet to overheat, freeze or make me feel compelled to throw it out the window in front of a moving bus, err I mean, compelled to root the phone and actually get more performance out of it. I have no problem disabling the unwanted apps that are pre-installed without looking up a tutorial to hack Google+ apps, etc...I have owned the phone for over 5 weeks and I cannot think of anything negative to say about it. It is worth every penny if you are not expecting every one of the ""bells & whistles"" that comes with a $600+ smart phone - and lets be realistic, most of those ""bells & whistles"" are not a practical necessity.The Moto E, in my opinion, is better than expected for the price and has yet to let me down. I absolutely recommend getting this phone.",1.0,4

Then I bought another one for my mom in 2012 from Amazon. Unfortunately she lost it a year later.My phone still runs great 3 years later. It got dropped, tossed, and kicked. I've dropped it a few times on concrete to the point where the back case and battery popped out; yet it still worked without issues. And aside from scratches on the case, it held up perfectly. Just be sure to find a good protective case to make it last longer.The speed is nothing to be proud of. It is slow. That's because it's a very small inexpensive phone that's meant for light internet use. If you just like to check email or facebook, this phone is great. The browser is slow as dirt, but again, it's not meant for the hard core internet user. Games are hard to play due to the small screen size, but i managed to get a few playable games in there.Perfect for your middle schooler who wants a smart phone. It won't break the wallet if they abuse or lose it, but it's a smartphone nonetheless. So if you want speed and more options, pay for the newer Samsung Galaxy phones. But if you just want a phone that has Android and can keep you connected to email, this would be perfect for you.",1.0,4

BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White,BLU,429.99,5,"While I was skeptical at first of this phones ability to do every day tasks It's never failed me. Here's my honest opinion and review on it.What's good about it?> This phone is extremely thin and everyone asks if it's fake. It's great haha> It has a 20% larger battery than the iPhone 6s.> The display is absolutely beautiful, deep inky blacks and vivid colours.> Super snappy and quick launch times for apps.> Has a relatively stock android skin. Everything that they added as a skin is great too.> Great Selfy camera. 5 MP vs the iphone's 1.5 MP one.> Beautiful Design.What's wrong with this then?> The Camera is 8 mega pixels which is the same as the iPhone 6 (my old phone), but Mega pixels mean nothing if you don't have the software to back it up. The pictures are fairly unsaturated and it is kind of slow at taking pictures.> Fingerprint magnet (black), if you don't have a case with it then you'll get it dirty fast grime.> No home buttons outside of the on screen ones. This is my personal opinion but phones that don't have either a home button or off screen buttons just don't feel as effective.> Bezels on this phone is kind of a shame. Since the bottom of the phone has nothing it's a bit off putting that there is nothing there.> For the first 2 days it actually seemed slow, but after using it for a couple days the phone sped up to being fast. No clue why.I suggest this phone if you are looking for something that is thin and if you are on a budget.",9.0,4

Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl Zeiss Optics Camera - Yellow,Nokia,99.99,5,"To begin I read about all the negative experiences with getting the right product. I did get the expected product...brand new and international. (Ordered from FGS Trading) The only hitch was it was definitely packaged for the European market as it arrived with a charging plug for the European use. I am in Canada. I have multiple 3.5 mm chargers so no biggie.Now on the phone. I first powered it on and had to change the language to English. Took all of 30 seconds. Holding the phone is a treat. To people who find this phone heavy. You should be concerned with the strength in your hands let alone the weight of this phone. This phone is meant be used with a slim case if any. It is extremely durable and you can feel the quality it it. To put it in perspective the famed iPhone 5 is 220 grams when adding on the very popular Otterbox Defender case. This phone weighs in at 185 grams. With my Nokia case (17 gms) it is 202 gms total. This makes that particular iPhone 5 and defender combo wider and heavier. You will rarely see people put this phone in a case. In fact there are not many cases made for this phone...maybe for that reason. Corning Gorilla Glass 2 also adds to this durability.It is definitely a looker. From front to back it just looks the business. I got the black matte to limit any possibilities and fingerprints and it just looks good. Colors are more likely to leave scratches as you can see with the iPhone 5c. They have the same case. Funny how apple has to make the iPhone 5c look so similar to that of Nokia colored phones but we will leave that topic alone.The fluidity of the phone is great... and simple. No clutter to report. I like having the ability to only have what I want on my home screen with the live tiles. All other apps are easily reached but tucked away. The camera of course is one of the most respected cameras on the market as Nokia is arguably the best on the market - the Lumia 1020 has taken away the steam of the 920 but it is still fantastic. I have used it for a month and my wife's iPhone does not compare. The screen is very good...uses the same technology as the iPhone 5s (IPS LCD)I really feel the app bashing windows gets is blown way out of proportion. Reason being is there are a lot of useful apps and its not cluttered with pointless ones (Something I experienced a lot with my Blackberry Z10 on blackberry world). I have found almost all the apps I would ever need. The third party counterparts are great unlike in blackberry world. I personally prefer quality over quantity. I really enjoy all the in house apps Nokia makes. Nokia MixRadio is fantastic as is their Camera app. Nokia Maps is very good and on par with Google Maps. Nokia makes so many of their own apps I find I am not needing to find the third party apps to use ad I prefer that as well.The only things I could think of that I feel could be improved upon is the lack notifications and the Windows keypad is not quite as up to par as the Blackberry10's (nothing comes close...including Apple and Android) Those are very minor issues and can be addressed with software updates.Anyone who says they are disappointed with this phone is weak handed and never gave it a chance and probably came from using an iPhone or Google and look at APP numbers. The Apps are coming. Apple has had 10 years to build up its app market...Windows is on 3. Its the experience I was after. I could afford an iPhone or an S4 but went with the Lumia. There is something about Windows 8 that is refreshing. Live tiles is a great concept that has potential to be more and who knows what will come with Windows Phone 8.1 update which is coming soon. That's my rant. If you like having the phone everyone else has stick to your iPhone. If you like to brag about specs get a top flight Android. If you prefer to have a lightweight operating system that just feels right...try a Lumia 920,1020 or above.",2.0,4

BLU Dash X Smartphone - Global GSM Unlocked - White,BLU,89.0,2,"This unit came with only 8GB of internal storage. I couldn't do much with that. I inserted an SD card and installed new apps only on it but that was of little help since a part of the app still got installed in the internal storage and once used, some of the data also. As I used the phone along, I kept getting warning that there was no storage left. I checked Settings and indeed, it said 0MB. I had to keep clearing data and eventually un-install all, except two, apps that I originally downloaded. Apps that came with the unit all were put in the internal storage and can't be moved anywhere nor uninsalled; they together took a big chunk of storage. I decided to return and am now awaiting the seller's approval. Do I recommend this phone? I do if all you want to do is making calls, texting, taking pics/videos,use Google map, and maybe play a few games. Beyond that, I don't. I guess I have to be willing to spend a little extra to get another phone with 32GB internal storage.March 21 update:In the last few days the phone was totally useless except for making/receiving calls. I couldn't even SMS. Finally I un-installed the last two apps I downloaded AND removed all updates from apps that came with the handset.

BlackBerry Bold 9900 GSM Factory Unlocked Phone - No Warranty (Black),BlackBerry,85.0,5,"So firstly about the product. This blackberry is so much fun to use, great OS and friendly interface. Of course the blackberry trademark qwerty keyboard and trackball are the usp. Cons are the touchscreen and the battery. I was fully aware of the limited battery life, but since its compensated for by the slim size, I feel its a decent tradeoff. Just need to remember to charge it pretty regularly and have bought a couple of extra chargers to keep at all places at all times. The touchscreen is not very intuitive and a little difficult to use if you have big fingers and of course doesn't compare to the apple experience, but the awesome trackpad helps out a lot. All in all a great device and I received it exactly as advertised by Worldwide Distributors. Its an unlocked AT&T phone which I received and if you are a t-mobile user you will not be able to use 3G. In case you are buying this, it would help if you contact the seller and ask them for the specific one (tmob/atnt) that you want. For me AT&T works just fine, guess I got lucky because I had not intimated the seller during my purchase. 5 stars for the bb 9900 \m/",0.0,3

But I managed, even texts, mail, contacts, music etc. I bought the phone for it's long battery life. I use the phone for work and play. I play golf and use an app and the GPS for the golf app can drain the phone leaving little or now power for work. Boo hoo. So, the J7 performs as advertised on the power front. I bought an extra battery, so I don't have to charge in the middle of the golf course and all is well. But the battery is so good, that I still have 75 percent of it after a full round of golf. The rest of the stuff, camera, phone, bluetooth, etc. work like they all do. Weak speakers, I mean really weak ... like ""high"" on the J7 is like nearly mute on the HTC. Just saying. If I listen to music or watch a you tube clip, it works fine. But I think they probably save the $300 on the speaker alone. I am not complaining.

Now I know there are defective items out there and that sometimes you get them, my big problem is that blu customer support has been nothing but a major pain in my you know what. since my phone was still under warranty I emailed them asking them for details on where to send my phone to have it fixed or replaced, 3 days later they email me back asking to fill out a report and so I did, 3 days later I get another email asking for more details on what is wrong, so again I tell them what the problem is, and you guessed it 3 days later I get another email with instructions on how to do a hard factory reset, and that was it. not a if that doesn't work then such and such just some instructions on something I can't even do because the phone won't power up at all. so my recommendation is save your money and buy a phone from a real company sure it might cost you more but if something happens to your phone you know it's not going to be a hassle to try and get it fixed.",,0

When I first powered it up I knew right away I was in for a disappointment when I heard the tacky 2001 style MIDI sound chime it made. Right off the bat it didn't sync up to my phone, I had to YouTube for a Bluetooth app that would actually sync the phone up to the watch. After it synced, I noticed I could not use Facebook, Twitter, or the Internet browser. The icons were there for basically show. The messaging app worked like my first Nokia phone did, terrible. The camera is a joke, but I really didn't care for the camera. Phone calls didn't turn out too bad. Other than that, there isn't anything you can do with it, pretty stripped down and not satisfying at all. The build quality is pretty decent, despite its horrible software. I Immediately boxed it back up and set up a return. I'm going to get a Sony Smart Watch 2, its the cheapest name brand smart watch you can buy, and after researching it, its way above this watches standards.

After a month of using it temporarily, I can say that it's a very good phone with a long battery life. You don't even need to tinker much with the settings. Its ""Smart Manager"" does a pretty good job.RAM wise, I don't know if it's for everyone. I have so many apps that I'm too lazy to uninstall so I'm already using 70% of the 1.5GB. Even then the phone is working smoothly. In my mom's case, 1.5GB is enough but I might need more than this.If I have to choose between RAM and battery life though, I'd choose battery life next time. Just bought a Moto X pure edition with 16GB, 3GB RAM but the Samsung still beat Motorola by a mile. I don't know though if it's because I upgraded the Moto to Android M. Good thing, I only paid $300 for the Moto X Pure edition (vs $250 for the Samsung J7 in Feb).Warranty-wise, I was trying to register the international J7 version on the US website but I could not find the model there. It says that if it's not a US model then I have to register on the international website. Even after several times, I wasn't able to register the phone successfully on the Phil website. I might end up trying to call them about it.headphone plug is at the bottom -- I prefer it on the top.I like the ""Outdoor"" setting so you can see the screen outside.I am not an expert but I like the graphics and sound quality.Samsung J7 is an excellent phone! I might end up with a Samsung next time.UPDATE:When I brought this home to the Philippines in April I put in a local micro-SIM card in one of the slots and it worked immediately. So far my mom has no issues with the phone. The only risk is that this phone has no warranty in both the US and the Philippines. A Samsung Service Center in the Philippines said that that they only provide warranty to locally purchased phones. They can still fix the phone of course for a price.",88.0,4

The all plastic body doesn't feel as premium as say the Moto X 2014, and is not water/liquid resistant. I would def suggest the 32 GB option since apps will easily fill up a 16 GB model.

It has many nice features but they are obstructed by the menu which is non-intuitive and not user friendly(to me anyway)Sending messages with video/audio/text is very easy and convenientCall quality is good, but I had many dropped calls (not sure was it network or the Dash itself.), Using speaker during a phone call, many people told me I sounded ""choppy"" or my voice varied in level; but I heard clear enoughSpeaker sound is a little tinny but not bad.Camera is just a ""dash"" below average-many pics were grainy, depending on lighting; likewise for video capture. Downloaded pics were more crispy, but got grainy with zooming in.Dealing with Windows Media Player is very very frustrating- cannot control files add/delete songs/videos; I could only play/stop/ full screen/ adjust volume-I couldn't access media files from inserted memory card, nor could I transfer them to the library (I am not a high tech guy so may be others will find that easy to handle).I used Wi-Fi (I don't have data plan); connectivity is not bad, but using the track ball is frustrating- movement was not precise; it is difficult to aim and click on something without hunting around it many times.Browsing speed was fast enough to me, but many times was hit and miss; the Dash will not allow me to type in (or get in) websites names directly; it only allowed search mode for them under Google-search, then I had to go through the search items , then hunt for the click spot, then click and click and wish it will connect!There is no refresh button( or at least I couldn't find it) once in a web page, and if a typo made in the website name there is no way to correct, but to go out and start again.The supplied head phones sounded OK, but little bulky and wouldn't stay in place.The head phone jack is awkward with its ""huge"" supplied adapter-I bought a smaller adapter but it didn't work with non-HTC head phones.When connected to the charger, the phone gets noticeably hot to touch- it is annoying that it will not tell you how much charge has accumulated, unless unpluggedI tried to get used to the Dash but couldn't and eventually decided to return it.

Until now, Samsung phones was the answer to my user needs. With the direction change, Samsung phones is no longer meet my user needs. Nowadays, power banks and fast charging phones make non eplaceable battery less of a problem. Expendable storage, sd card slots are a must for some of us and with the prices we pay, I think it is a feature we need to demand as consumers.Lg has the answer to my needs this time around as this is my first LG phone. I am pleasantly surprised, actually shocked with this phone.What I love:I have 4G LTE over ATT. I did not expect this as usually you don't get US LTE from international phones.I have 40 gigs of classical music flac files in it and it sounds amazing and it has enough power to drive high impedance headphones like HD650 without an amp. For me this is an amazing plus and keeps me happy. I have heavenly music with me at all times, and the way it sounds puts a smile on my face.Screen is amazing. It is bright enough to see under the sun easily. I use the Kindle app a lot and it is great on this phone. Pics look great on this large screen; pleasantly colorful but not oversaturated.Cell and wifi reception is stronger than any other phone I have used; this was a big surprise and it is an enormous plus.It is rugged enough for a teacher and traveler.What could be better:Battery life is not the best but no worse than latest iphones and galaxy s6 line of phones but replaceable battery makes up for itOn this model, there are some Korean apps; most you can uninstall and some you can not.Some settings are hard to find because they are stashed in unexpected places.You will need to install a file manager as stock file manager is weak.Now there is an app on app store so you can use the HD DAC with any music app; this was a problem until now.It is an amazing phone for the type of user I am and I don't see any other phone will trump the pluses this one bring any time soon.",4.0,4

LG G2 D800 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE 2.26 GHz Quad-Core Android Smartphone with 13 MP Camera (White),LG,199.99,1,"This phone is the biggest piece of junk ever! I purchased it as a gift for my father. It was to be his first smart phone, so I did not want to break the bank, only to find that he could not learn how to use the device. (He is in his mid 70's and not too savvy with technology) The main reason that my dad wanted to try a smart phone is because he is an avid golfer and really likes the golf apps that I was use on my phone, especially my golf GPS app. Despite doing my homework on this phone, I did not find out about the defective GPS in many of the G2 phones. The GPS just does not work, which means that that any and all of the Golf GPS apps don't work either. Also, the phone has the worst cell phone reception of any phone that I have ever seen. My nephews's $80.00 no-name smart phone receives cell signals better than this piece of junk, as we tested the two phones out, side by side, from multiple locations, and the G2 did not come even close. Long story short, don't be duped like I was. I now have a $200 paperweight sitting in my desk drawer. The only saving grace is that I am a school teacher and my students will be able to use the device as amini tablet over WiFi, but this still has been a very expensive lesson to learn. I would have returned it, but I purchased the phone in late April and gave it to my dad as a Father Day gift, which was pass the 30 day return window. I will not make that mistake again.",1.0,0

It would not turn off or on or do anything. I knew that this was an international phone, but I did not know that SAMSUNG US was not able to help me. This phone apparently has a different OS than those in the US. Even though I have a 24 month warranty on the phone, I could not simply return it to the retailer for a replacement (who was very pleasant and tried to be helpful over the phone but when you pay this much for a product you expect better), because it was beyond 30 days. I was first told to contact SAMSUNG Vietnam, but they responded that the phone was distributed in Africa and that I needed to contact SAMSUNG Nigeria. They said that I would need to send the phone in and pay for shipping, which is not cheap. I did end up sending it, and now I have still not received my phone back after 3 weeks.

(Model#: E550 NAVY BLUE)",Posh Mobile,95.0,5,"I decided two years ago to never again pay more than $100 for a phone, as I believe it is better to put my money into a good tablet or laptop. I don't use my phone for games, and only put on it the most essential apps, since these ""free"" games and apps have access to all your contacts, phone logs, email, and location. I have plenty of other tablets and laptops to play games on whenever I want. I use my phone for calls, texts, and occasionally email.I love the Windows phones, but they appear to be dying, so I looked for my next replacement. I couldn't decide on this or the Blu Amazon phone, so I got both. My plan was to use the Posh for my audio books (which I listen to constantly), and the other one as my phone. I bought this more as a joke than a serious phone, and at $30, why not? The small size seemed ideal for me, as I spend a lot of time walking my two Golden Lab pups through the woods, and I have too much gear packed into my Scottevest already.I opened up both phones, set up the Blu, which is bigger than any other phone I have been using, and seemed very limited. I was not at all impressed.Then I set up the Posh, and fell in LOVE with it. It doesn't have a ton of memory, but has plenty for what I need it for. It even fits perfectly in the license ID holder in my vest, and weighs next to nothing. I decided to use this as my phone instead.The only hard part was the one time log in to my essential accounts, the keyboard is tiny. I can't imagine typing text messages on it, but it works just fine using the microphone. For most things you can use the microphone instead of the keyboard. Which I'm sure is why they call it a ""Micro"" phone.Just as I got it all set up, I dropped it on concrete. Yup, shattered the screen. It is still usable, but I decided to replace it because I like it that much.I logged in to buy another one, only to find the price had gone up to $50. It seems other people also liked this phone, and demand had driven the price up.If it ever comes back to $30, I'm buying a case of them. They would make great gifts. And I'm sure I will drop it again, as I am a klutz.But even at $50, it is a great deal.",,4

HTC One Max 32GB 4G LTE Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Silver,HTC,348.68,5,"I know that the Max got some negative and mixed reviews, but the thing is a masterpiece. The main complaints against it were the fingerprint scanner, the size, and the snapdragon processor.First off, the fingerprint scanner is perfectly fine as is. The position on the back of the device makes it perfectly positioned so that you can just grab the phone and get to it. If you want to use a fingerprint scanner on your phone then this model is the quickest way to unlock your phone. Go ahead and race your buddies and you'll see. Yes, you might rub your finger on the lens of your camera occasionally, but it's not nearly as big a deal as it was made out to be.The size of the phone is the best part in my opinion. It is hard to fit in a pocket and a little heavier than most. But it's worth it for the large screen size and dual front facing boomsound speakers. It makes the phone perfect for any type of media. And every app is enhanced with a larger screen, I use it for most of my reports and make excel and power point documents on it with ease. The weight is just a few extra grams than other phablets, but with any type of phablets you're going to look kind of ridiculous with it, so just grab a cheap bluetooth. Problem solved.Yes, it's not as powerful as other phablets, but the only performance difference that I've noticed is that the battery lasts significantly longer than other phablets. I've been surfacing the Web, downloading large amounts of data, using bluetooth, using WiFi, watching movies and playing games for the last ten hours nonstop and I have 39% battery left without using any power savers.If you buy it then you will love it.",5.0,4

Not a huge deal but i wish it had a signal led for messages and such. Also for an 8core processor it wasn't as fast as i expected it to be, in fact with the new found reception i got along with the phone it felt much slower then my previous phone( the Blu Life view, Loved it.) And as of now the phone is no longer charging, seems something has happened with the usb port. Just disappointing considering i've only had the phone a few months or so.

It's just as advertised, no cosmetic problems, right storage size. But the battery is terrible. Firstly, it came with a fake battery that wasn't made by Samsung. It said it was ""manufactured by elentec""? I've never heard of it and its clearly unofficial.I bought an official battery from a local tech store, but the poor battery life wasn't fixed. The phone discharges by 50% over the course of the day even if you're not using it. It just drains so heavily for no reason. I know it's the phone, as I've used two different batteries and disabled any kind of background applications.Under any heavy use, the battery life just disappears and the phone gets horribly hot. Making a phone call is actually unpleasant as the phone touching my face is so hot.All in all the phone is fine, but this battery life is just so poor. Buying this phone is kind of a hit or miss; it seems you can get a working one or a dud. As I can't afford a better seller, I'm not returning it, but a portable charger is basically a requirement with this phone.As an example, my phone lost 9% charge as I was writing this review on it.

It has a dual camera like any android phones with the 5.0MP back camera and 2.0MP front camera that both has flash for picture taking. Cameras are clear and doesn’t have any problem on it.This phone supports 3G GSM QuadBand so you might need to get GSM/WCDMA sim card and not the CDMA.Mediatek MTK Quadcore with RAM of 1GB and ROM of 8GB.The phone is programed to be in different language and those are:- English- Bahasa Indonesia- Bahasa Melayu- Burmese- Cestina- Deutsch- Espanol- French- Italiano- Netherlands- Portuguese- Vietnamese- Turkish- Greek- Russian- Hebrew- Arabic- Persian- Thai- Simplified and Traditional ChineseOther features include:3G, WiFi, GPS, FM, Bluetooth, Email, Messaging,Wallpapers, Calendar, Calculator, Clock, Camera, Play Store, Tethering & portable hotspot, etcThe packaging is great as shown in my video.

Motorola Flipside MB508 Black WiFi Android GSM QuadBand 3G Cell Phone,Motorola,29.88,3,"The rating reflects the balance between value and performance. This phone is cheap - 15% of the cost of a top end Smartphone but performance is poor - you get what you pay for.The plus points - It's cheap. - it runs on WiFi - this is a huge plus as you don't need to pay for phone network data. Set updates and data delivery to WiFi only - It has a keyboard - touchscreen input on cheap phones with small screens is a nightmare, - it works fine on Skype (and with rear camera allowing video calls) - and this combines with the use of WiFi giving free/low cost calls anywhere you can get WiFi - Screen is good - e-mail easy to set up - slot for Micro SD. - small trackpad at bottom of phone very useful for highlighting and selecting web options - avoids the issue of hitting the wrong option with a finger on a tiny screenThe Minus Points- Insufficient internal phone memory - load Skype and update to Play Store and that's about it. Out of memory!! This is THE major problem with the phone. (Why did Motorola not add more memory?)- Usually won't run videos - probably related to above- No UMA - if mobile network coverage is poor some phones can route calls through WiFi. Very useful if you live in a poor coverage area. This phone can't do it.- Associated Motorola PC software randomly consumes huge amounts of CPU time even when the phone is not connected!! Don't bother installing.- lots of AT&T bloatware that consumes what little memory there is and usually is expensive to use- no flash on the camera.Part of the solution to the memory problem (which is the real downside to this phone) is to root the phone and then delete the bloatware and move the applications to the sd card. But it's not as easy as it seems. Rooting goes OK but applications won't always move and there's not much memory there anyway. And with rooting you risk bricking the phone. Yet to be tried is partitioning the sd card to act as phone memory. If this works it should solve the memory issue but we'll see. I'll post an update.Overall - if you want a low-cost smartphone with easy data input (the keyboard), access to e-mail, free WiFi-based surfing and Skype this is for you. But don't expect to be able to download many apps or be able to play much (if anything)in the way of streamed video.",3.0,2

Blackberry Q10 SQN100-1 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked GSM Dual-Core OS 10 Smartphone - Black,BlackBerry,149.95,3,"My driving reason behind getting this particular phone was that I'm die-hard Qwerty & BlackBerry seems to be the only manufacturer keepin' the dream alive.First thing I loved about this baby was the size & look of the phone. Classic BB design yet still contemporary enough that you won't hear any stupid remarks from people about how ""you need to get a new phone"". Lightweight & perfect size if you don't want to feel like you're walking around with a flat-screen in your pocket.For the most part the phone delivers on the qwerty level. Well made keyboard, perfect size,texture,spacing,etc. Unfortunately, there's no trackball(as with prev. BB models) or any ""arrow"" keys thus all cursor control is touchscreen which is annoying before you get the hang of it.Getting service with AT&T was no problem. Wi-fi,Bluetooth,multi-media all seem to function fine. Slight peeve for me is limited profile options for volume control. You basically have only ""Normal/Silent/Vibrate or Off"".Now, this is what's really troubling; No Android. Unless I'm overlooking something this phone has no android capacity or capability contrary to another purchaser's comment.I Repeat: No! Android! It's 2015 & I need my Android, it's really that simple.If you're like me & need your qwerty but don't have or want to spend $500+ on some of the higher end BB's with a keyboard, then this may be your phone.

Verizon LG enV3 VX9200 No Contract 3G QWERTY MP3 Camera Cell Phone Red,LG,18.22,1,"First, we purchased the phone as a replacement for my mother.The first issue was that right out of the box, the phone had some sort of PIN code that had it locked, the seller had no idea what to tell me. I finally guessed the PIN and it was 0000. I don't know if this is a factory setting or if I bought a new phone that was actually used, I can't be sure. All I know is I could find nothing in the documentation that referenced a default lock on the phone. If this is my mistake, someone please correct this review, I want to be fair.The second and bigger issue is the battery. It won't hold a charge at all. Fortunately, the old battery in her old phone was still in useable condition so we just swapped it out. I didn't bother contacting the seller yet again because quite frankly, it wasn't worth my time and most likely, I'd get stuck with shipping charges again.If you are thinking about buying, I would move on to something else and buy from somewhere else.",0.0,0

Sony Xperia ZR C5502 Unlocked Phone--U.S. Warranty (Pink),Sony,129.95,5,"This phone was surprisingly awesome. I researched it and read lots of great things. I expected the phone to let me down but it met all expectations and even surpassed some. It has great features. I love the face recognition security feature, even though it can be tricked. The indicator light is a bar at the bottom, below the screen. The light can be customized with different colors if you download an app. The picture is great. My hands are small so the size of the phone is perfect. I have tested the phones water resistance and it keeps its promise. It was in the river and my iPhone was killed but the Sony was ok, just muddy. I had no problems with the microphone afterward, as some say they do. It was a great feeling rinsing it off later. If I was going to complain, It would be that after using other phones, I wished it had soft buttons and a hard home button below the viewing screen. The buttons appear at the bottom of the screen, or on the side if in landscape, and use part of the viewing area. But the way its done is good. I expected it to feel cheap because they call it the Mid-range version of the z series. I have bought the c5502 and it has H+ and 3G but does not have 4G LTE. I think the c5503 has 4G. I bought this version understanding that because it is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. I wanted flexibility and options with my service providers. I use this phone with straight talk on the AT&T network and it works fantastic in my area. The processes run smooth and quick. This phone received an updated to 4.4.2 and did experience battery drain, but it seems to be fine now after some other apps have had updates. I'm hoping Sony will give it another update before it is too old. The Sony preloaded apps are more useful than bloatware that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I was a little disappointed you cant scroll through the home screens seamlessly, once you scroll to the last one it requires you to return the other way. The phone allows a microSD for extra memory but it will not allow you to transfer apps to the card. I'm hoping another update will change that. The phone has plenty of memory for my apps, but I would like the option for more.",0.0,2
Glocalme G1S Global Unlocked Mobile Wi-Fi Hotspot Roaming-Free SIM-Free Support Over 108 Countries with 2GB Initial Global Data Equals 60EUR,Glocalme®,98.99,4,"I THINK I'm going to love this thing. But a few heads up for first-timers like me.I read most of the other reviews and--maybe I'm a dunce--but it was not that all that easy to set-up. The instructions are rather confusing and unclear. They use the term ""your device"" sometimes referring to G1S and other meaning the iPhone (or whatever piece of equipment you'll be using with the G1S.) They also don't explain you need to CHARGE the device first (yes, I know this is normal) but usually that is Step 1. Also, how to charge it and plug it in is not explained. (It's not by using he USB port on its bottom, it's with the mini port on the side and plugging the massive USB at the other end of cord into your ""device"" as in iPad or laptop.)My iPad wouldn't take the scan of the QR code to add the 60 Euros...but after repeated attempts it eventually did.The Password needed to log into the wi-fi 'station' that shows up on your laptop/iPad is visible on the G1S screen, but first you have to scroll to the right to find it with the right arrow button. Stuff like that, which is figured out by trial and error. It also keeps reading that I only have the initial 99.00 megs (on the iPad app for it) even though I successfully 'Topped it Off' with the 60 Euros?? Maybe that will kick in once I go thru the initial 100Megs it comes with? Not sure. We are leaving for the UK in three days and I will post an update later. For now, I think it is up and working....i have used it here in Idaho briefly.",1.0,3

Nice little extras: it has an FM radio receiver, two SIM card slow, the battery can be replaced (unlike many recent high end phones), and it comes with a pair of earphones and a well designed wall charger (with a tiny LED -- I don't think chargers that come with high end phones usually have that).The charger is the standard micro USB, and the phone feels a lot like a slightly smaller version of the Nexus S from a few years ago.Personally I'm going to use this as a ""work"" phone, synced to my work account so that I can check emails in an emergency, but I can turn it off when I want to really focus on my personal life. And the low price means I won't feel too sorry if I lose / break it.Update 2015.07.27: Still thinking it's a pretty good deal, but removing one star as I'm really finding that the phone is a little too slow for daily (even very light) usage",0.0,3

So all I'm really looking for is an mp3 player that's easy to wear, with a time function and possibly texting in a pinch, not a device to be my new best friend.I first tried a GT08, which seemed to work nicely but it bothered me when I noticed I had paid twice as much as I should have (the problem with these Chinese knock-offs is the same product is available from different sellers at vastly different price points). Plus I really disliked the ""nucleus"" menu style, so thought I'd try a different model.There was a lot to like about the CNPGD. Right out of the box, the silver metal finish looks very high quality and the band is much nicer than the GT08, very supple and comfortable. The menus are much cleaner and easier to navigate, having only 4 rather than 8 (mostly useless) options per screen. It let me transfer all my music into the required ""my music"" folder (something I suspect all these watches have in common to use the music player from your SD card) via PC, much more painless than the GT08 that made me hand select each song from the watch screen individually to move (note: I had to reboot the watch for it to find them, a minor inconvenience since the boot sequence is very quick).However, the love affair ended instantly when I realized to my dismay there was no shuffle option to be found anywhere for the player. I really wish if this isn't to be a standard feature that it would be mentioned in the item description. Who wants to listen to their playlist straight through in alphabetical order? Stupidest omission on an mp3 player ever.Another maybe not so small complaint is there seems to be no way to change the truly ugly watch face -- tapping the screen (which the GT08 required) did nothing, and I couldn't find any theme settings anywhere (not like there are a ton of places to look).So the search continues. Thank goodness for Amazon's painless return process, however I'm now out $12 in return shipping fees. If my third attempt is a bust, I may have to start considering something in a much higher price range (although from what reviews I've read on a few products, that's not necessarily a guarantee of quality either).",1.0,1

"Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini G730A Unlocked Cellphone, Blue",Samsung,129.0,5,"Great small phone!I'm apparently the last man on earth who thinks a phone should fit in your pocket, and primarily serve as a phone. Yes, I love the smartphone features - email, video, websurfing, etc - but most of my life I'm easily within 10-20 feet of a real computer - with a real monitor and a real keyboard. And if I'm doing email it's way more efficient to do it on a real keyboard, web surfing is infinitely easier with a mouse and a 20"" monitor, and video is best seen on something properly sized. The difference between a 4"" screen and a 6"" screen for all is miniscule - it's like saying I prefer to use a 3/4"" garden hose to put the fire out instead of a 1/2"" hose - when there's a real firehose hooked up to a real hydrant right next to you....Meanwhile, aside from the size being perfect, this phone works great with my T-Mobile service. It also has an SD card slot, wihich I love for moving large files and pictures off the internal memory but the recent Android updates that prevent most apps from storing their data there limit that usability.I understand the issues preventing you from moving apps to external storage, but why would anyone in their right mind not allow a camera app or a podcast app to store it's data on external SD? That's just stupid, but that's out of our control.Meanwhile, battery life is good - but not great. It's a small battery so I understand. I get a day out of it and that's about it.If you're the type that thinks the difference in screen resolution between X and Y pixels is a make or break issue (which obviously means you put far too much importance into watching entertainment on a screen that is far too small for that...) I'm sorry but I can't either gush about the fantastic resolution or gripe about the low resolution - whatever it is. Cat videos look fine, as do pictures.I've used six or seven different phones now including a couple varieties of I-devices, and so far I like this one the best.",45.0,4

BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Blue,BLU,18.93,5,"This phone is $20. I'm dumbfounded by the reviews that complain it doesn't have this or that. Let's be real, this is a backup / emergency / throwaway phone and that's all it is. If you want it for that purpose, it does every thing you need. If you plan on using this day in and day out as a prepaid phone, you're going to want to go with something with a little more features. This phone has a 30 day standby battery life and it sits in my emergency bag. That's exactly what this phone is for. The controls are not slick, the construction sucks and is cheap, and the sim card is hard to remove, but honestly, if I ever had to use this and the time on that card, chances are I'd drop another 20 bucks for a new one.

Audio both speaker and with head phones is poor (with head phones you have to put it on the highest volume, and even then you could barely hear).Came quickly (about two business days), decent price, average budget Samsung phone. Wish it had better display and audio and then it would be 4 stars.Also I chose Gold and had to get use to it, but now I adore the color since it's sorta metallic yet subtle.Update: After three months of having this device I have noticed the following: Poor audio still, bad cell reception, developed a white dead pixel, is a standard samsung phone but doesn't have the highest resolution.

BLU Q170T Samba TV Unlocked Dual SIM Quad-Band GSM Phone (Black/Red),BLU,19.78,4,"We purchased two of these for travel to Italy and couldn't be happier. We picked up a SIM from TIM mobile (Italy's largest cell provider offered a sim with 300 minutes and 300 outbound texts for about 20 Euro) and the phones worked as expected for texting and phone calls, which is just what we needed to communicate when our family split for separate excursions or to contact locals.Two annoying things about our phones: (1) I couldn't easily discover how to do a keyboard lock, so there were many instances of pocket dialing ... eventually, I found the feature exists as an auto-lock: menu>>settings>>security settings>>auto keypad lock. (2) The battery level indicator always showed full, even when the battery was dead.In case anyone is interested, here are three annoying things about TIM Mobile (I wanted Vodaphone, but couldn't find a shop nearby): (1) The date and time were not auto-set by TIM, so we were always looking at a date in 1980 ... this is not a phone issue, but an issue with compatibility with TIM ... when we got back to the USA, the TIM SIM locked onto AT&T and the date/time were properly set. (2) TIM will initially allow international texting, but will eventually block it ... I had heard this was the case a few years back, but I thought they no longer did it. They do, and I believe you have to go to a TIM store and get the feature re-enabled. (3) TIM does not have an English option, so everything will be in Italian.",3.0,0

I really liked the phone but it wouldn't recognize the sim card so I called HTC. I was been given the run around for 3 days. They wanted a copy of the invoice. I had Amazon send them the information they requested. Then they told me that information wasn't good enough and they needed more information. (It was exactly what they requested) Amazon once again sent them the additional information they requested. They claimed they gave Amazon a wrong e-mail address and didn't receive it. Amazon had copied me on the e-mail so I resent it using yet another e-mail address. Again, they told me that information was not good and informed me that buying from Amazon was the same as buying off Craigs List or Ebay and that they would not warranty or fix my phone. They told me this phone was manufactured for Indonesia - not the United States and that this phone was over 3 years old and now obsolete.. Hmm, this was after numerous phone calls to them with over 8 different representatives from HTC. First I was told that this was a common problem and all I needed was a sim card tray. Then I was told that was not correct, there is no sim card tray for this phone and they would not discuss anything until the warranty issue was resolved. After numerous calls, they finally told me the phone was not meant to work in the United States and that Amazon does not use authorized retailers of their product and compared Amazon to Craigs List and Ebay.

So just as a fair warning to all the phone needs to have a micro-sim . I also don't agree with those who are giving negative feedback. It's a great screen very bright although the 8MP camera could be slightly stronger than what it is. It does have auto focus on the camera the 2MP is sort of crappy too.

There is a font magnifier on the E6, but it is lacking. Connection to my wireless carrier is so-so. Constant drop offs in signals. I will be returning the E6 to Amazon for a refund. Nokia was a top brand at one time and I am surprised at the company's downward spiral. I guess it wants to follow Blackberry's path. Contacted Nokia support and unfortunately, they were not helpful. Read the customer reviews here before my purchase and I should have listened to the negative reviews. I will say the E6 is by far the best cell phone I have had in terms of quality construction.

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 64GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,299.0,5,"This is my 4th budget Moto smartphone. I've owned and used the Moto g1 as well as the 1st and 2nd gen Moto E. The Moto G4 is far superior to all of those but it doesn't have the same magic that the original Moto G had.I really think that Google took over Motorola and made the Moto G1 with the main intention of making the company more appealing to sell. Google sold Motorola for a very good profit to Lenovo shortly after the great success of the Moto G. I still have my Moto G1 and very much cherish that phone for it's great features and excellent build quality.I purchased the Moto G4 with 64gig hd and 4 gig of RAM so that I wouldn't need to worry about space for my apps. Converting micro SD cards as internal storage in Marshmellow doesn't work as well as it should. Apps need to be supported for this feature and only a handful in the app store seem to be. Plus only very high speed memory cards will work properly. All three of my class 10 cards by PNY, Sandisk, and Lexar get a warning stating that they are too slow when I try to make them part of the internal storage. The screen is sharp although I prefer the look of the 5.5 inch 1080p IPS screen on the iPhone 6plus. I don't know what it is but the screen on the Moto G just doesn't have the same vibrancy or quality. Still, the Motor G4 screen is plenty bright and nice to look at.The front facing speaker sounds great and buttons feel mostly responsive when pressed. The fingerprint scanner works better than any other phone I've tried.Turbo charging is also a great feature that I couldn't live without especially since I usually have to charge the Moto G4 in the afternoon to comfortably get through the evening. I've been getting about 4 hours of screen on time between charges. The camera takes decent pictures and focuses quickly. Most everything on this phone is really nice and snappy. NFC might be a feature some will miss, not me though.Even though to me the Moto G4 doesn't make me giddy like the orifinal Moto G, my opninion is that you can't go wrong with this purchase. The Moto G4 really is a good phone for someone who needs a device that works well, has the important premium features, and doesn't break the bank.",11.0,4

Unlocked Quad-band S29 Smart Watch Phone Micro SD Card SIM Card Bluetooth Wrist Smartwatch Smart Mobile Phone (Golden),,59.99,5,"Update: 4-6-2016TL;DR: Upgrading to 5 stars. This is a great watch for the money. CNPGD did a great job once again. If you want a sharp looking round-face design smart watch on the cheap, then this is a very solid build with excellent screen and feature set. You might need a different app for Android 5.0+ than what it comes with. Dig below for the app description.UPDATE: Take the time to install the right app. There is no way this is a 2 star smart watch unless you are expecting it to have a feature set other than what it actually is: a smart watch. It's not a phone watch, it's not a hybrid calling watch, it's just a fantastic little smart watch.By request - ALL the details:This watch has a lot going for it, with a couple of nit-picky cons. Let's start out with my device specs: UPDATE: Phone switch to - Digital Reign Journey Phablet with Android KitKat. Keep this in mind during the following information regarding the app, etc.# First thing is ... the mobile app that goes with the watch. It has a QR code built into the watch. Scan it and grab the app. Very nice looking app. I found one I like even better called ""TRULY SmartDevice"" - it is nearly identical in appearance and functionality, plus it works perfectly with the watch using my phone/tablet. If the scanned app doesn't work for you, go grab the one I mentioned and you will be all set. 100% all notifications push for the Android. I do not own Apple products to test for you sorry. Also, this app has a 'scan' feature. If you have trouble using in combo with a headset, just check on Scan, and choose your watch. Probably got switched to your headset when it connected. Done.UPDATE: TRULY SmartDevice app allows the install of weather applet. Works great. Wish there were more applets!# Construction of this watch is top notch. Metal housing, plastic back and face/screen, and magnetic charger make this look and feel first rate. Lots of compliments in the first two days of wear. Not a flawed bevel or 'squeezable' creaky seam to be found.UPDATE: I have really put this poor thing through its paces lately and it has stood up to some real abuse. Heavy rain, got beaten against a door frame several times hauling equipment around, wasn't paying attention scrubbing up and completely doused it in the sink (at which point it powered off by itself and I thought I had fried it! Dried it off and it has worked ever since.), etc. Still works like a champ.# Bluetooth connectivity is great. What's that mean? I mean it is solid. Stable. Great range. Freaky range actually. I have a PLT_Legend Headset which has amazing range, and I will hear 'beep... phone 1 disconnected' right before I start feeling my wrist vibrate to warn me it is losing signal. Works great with headsets by the way.# Charged this on the first day in about 1.5 hours from 'low battery' warning to full charge. I have been playing around with it quite a bit, playing music, taking and making calls with it for fun, and I get a LOT of messages, emails, skype, case notifications via specialized apps, etc. as a contractor just in regular use.UPDATE: I am changing this to an average of 3 days. You will get anywhere from 2 to 4+ days depending on how much it gets used. Really, it is up to you how much life you get out of it, but either way - you'll never have to worry about battery life. It's incredible.# No battery draining extras. This is what it is: A Smart Watch. No SIM card slot, No TF slot, nothing. Just give you notifications and has a few nice apps like Pedometer and such that seem to work ok. I've tested it all (aside from 'Siri' since I don't own Apple stoofs) and it all appears to work as it should.# Sound is simply fantastic. If CNPGD is good at anything - this seems to be it. Louder than any name brand watch I've messed with, crystal clear, and music reproduction is pretty amazing. Outright enjoyable to listen to in fact. Microphone works well according to the several people I tested it with.# The wristband is very nice quality. The underside is an almost suede texture making it very comfortable to wear, but read on to see one nit-pick that you should know about below.-> Lastly, there are a couple of things you should know before buying just in case any of these might be a deal breaker for you:# If you have large wrists, you will have to buy a longer wristband. I have what I would consider medium to even smallish wrists for a man. I am using the *last* hole on the band and I mean it is exactly comfortable. Any shorter and I wouldn't be able to wear it.UPDATE: Most moto360 bands can be modified to use with this. Leather bands are super easy to just widen the gap a bit. Metal bands are pretty simple to just use band itself and set pins - most of the link gaps are wide enough.# If you are partial to a digital display (i.e. large numbers displayed like 12:15 PM instead of an analog clock) then this will not work for you. There are 5 different watch faces, all of them are nice in their own way and a couple of them are downright amazing. However I am surprised there is no 'digital watch' option for viewing the time. Keep this in mind when ordering.UPDATE: This remains my only gripe, although it is not an issue since a couple of the faces I really like as it is.Overall, I am really enjoying this watch so far and will give regular updates as time goes on just as I did with my previous CNPGD watch. I will miss it dearly as it served me without fail for over a year's brutal abuse by my person. It's final accidental crunch under my foot gives way to this new adventure.UPDATE: So far this watch is every bit the gem my previous model was. I'm really on board with CNPGD products at this point. Bang for your buck, this is hard to beat.",6.0,4

OtterBox Defender Series Case for Apple iPhone 6 Plus - Ink Blot,,24.99,3,I love Otterbox cases. They are THE best. I had a case on my iPhone 6 plus and I messed up the button cover..

I don't know if it's from the way they stored it or if just the slightest amount of extra material was used in the manufacturing process. It is annoying - I tried to find a way to request a replacement but the only option offered is a return. So I guess I will buy another one before returning this one so my phone stays protected..

"BLU VIVO 5 Smartphone -5.5"" 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 32GB +3GB RAM - Gold",BLU,199.99,4,"So far I'm impressed with the look, feel, and functionality of the phone itself. The phone is lightweight, graphics are clear, and app speed is noteworthy. It truly is a match in size, graphics, picture taking, and functionality to the more expensive phones. I took off one star because of the screen protector that comes with the phone: garbage. I'm still trying to figure out if the bubbles come from lint on the phone, which I cleaned repeatedly before application, or on the screen protector itself. I ended up taking the protector off after only a few hours because it was interrupting the beautiful quality of the graphics. TIP FOR MANUFACTURER: Design a better screen protector or don't send one with the phone. Application of the protector is a waste of consumer time. The phone case is not bad.9/7/2016 - Have had the phone for two months and do enjoy it, for the most part, but BLU could do better with keeping up with Android OS upgrades. This phone is still on 5.1 Lollipop and there is no talk of upgrading to 6.0 Marshmallow or 7.0 Nougat in the near future it at all, for that matter. The biggest drawback for me is the phone keeps defaulting to APN settings for Net10, but I'm on T-Mobile. When I add the T-Mobile settings and remove Net10, the phone stops working.BLU you've got a good concept here, but it would be nice to see you give more consideration to your customers' needs.",1.0,3

BLU LIFE ONE X2 - 4G LTE Unlocked Smartphone - 16GB+2GB RAM - Grey,,149.99,3,"This phone is killer. It's fast, dependable, and stylish. I was worried about going down to the 3000 mAh battery (used to the Blu Studio Energy 5000 mAh battery) but the fast charger makes it so I don't need to be charged as long. I've got 4x the apps I had on my old phone and still have 2/3 of the memory left (without expanding via micro SD). The only flaws I see are:1. (with all Blu phones I've used) the screen protector is nearly impossible to apply. I've yet to use one with the 4 Blu phones I've used.2. The silicone case doesn't seem to fit well with this phone. Not sure if it's because of the curved display or what but I'll likely be buying a new case ASAP. ***Edit one month later*** The phone slipped out of the case tonight and the screen, left unprotected, cracked.

Touchwiz is just awkward to me and I'm still trying to tell if its because I'm coming from Sense or if it really is just awkward.On an Android you have access to plenty of add ons - games entertainment etc - supplied by Samsung, Amazon and Google Play (I have no idea why someone would want an iPhone). For the S6 Edge there are Samsung apps customized for it including a bunch of apps that can run along the edge called ""Edge Specials"".

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Silver,BLU,139.0,2,"So, this phone was great. Good battery, decent camera, not too slow and obviously great price. Used this for a few months (4 or 5 maybe) and just ran an update from BLU. And now my phone won't start anymore. It's stuck on the boot screen ""BLU BOLD LIKE US"". By pushing the power button and holding it down, I managed to turn it off. Upon boot, I ran a factory reset, as this normally takes care of any update issues. Not this time though, still won't boot. What kind of update from hell is this? If anybody has any solution, please contact me. I really like this phone and would like to give it a 5 Star review, but can't while it won't boot due to an update they provided.

Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty,Samsung,472.49,5,"I've been using this phone for a couple of days now, and after watching, reading, and hearing all these reviews as well as feedback from others, I had an idea of what to expect going into purchasing this device.I saw a few have issues with the phone bending, similar to the iPhone 6 Plus when that first released. I've been babying it and taking care of the phone as much as possible, and in that time I've fallen in love. My personal experience is the UI is nice and clean, similar to stock Android with a few added extras, and it's very responsive. I know it's not 4K all the time, and until the Marshmallow update releases, there won't be much support as of yet, however the up scaling of videos in the YouTube app still look simply amazing. The camera isn't really want most hyped it up to be, but I find that it works well and edges out my Note 4 and my father's iPhone 6S Plus, which is perfect enough for me.From the general feel of the build quality, I'd have to mark Sony down as the ""Apple"" of Androids, since I haven't personally felt that the other Android devices did it for me. I tried the Note 5, S6 Edge Plus, iPhone 6S Plus, Nexus 6P, and multiple others, but the Xperia takes the cake in feeling the most premium to me. Calls sound crystal clear, and the front facing speakers, while not as powerful as some HTC or Motorola phones, still sound much better than my previous iPhone.All in all, love the device, hope Sony continues to push out updates for it in the future, and I may stick with them should they continue producing this type of quality into their devices.",3.0,4

At the time I first bought this phone, it was still considered out of date, but I didn't care. I was very excited to finally have an all in one high quality music player, cell phone, and handheld computer. I remember being most excited, besides the app inclusions, that this product had 32 whole gb to play with. That was more than I'd ever had in my mp3 players/ ipods of the past.Pros-Huge GB Space-App Store-High quality music playback (However, I believe the Sansa line of Mp3 players has a much better quality of music playback and higher volume offering. This is the only one I have found.)-Glass pieces rather than plastic-Unlocked for use with multiple phone servicesCons-Buggy at times-Outdated-Does not support many apps-New OS does not run very smoothly on this-One speaker was busted-Grossly overpriced-You can find an Andriod that improves on this system in every way for a quarter of the priceI have since updated to a less expensive Android phone with expandable memory (LG K700) as even the cheap ones run better OS than this old thing nowadays. For the time though, this piece of software was very innovative and very exciting to have. If you are in the market for a new phone, I would recommend a newer piece of equipment though, rather than springing for this item, even if it is the Apple Store you are looking for. Many apps do not even run on this any longer. A new andriod would save your pocket some dough, and offer you higher improvements.",0.0,0

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Silver,BLU,139.0,5,"I am known among my family and friends as a bit of a gadget geek. My previous three phones were a Nexus 4, a Nexus 5, and a OnePlus One, and I'm always interested in what the latest and greatest devices Android has to offer. Well, when my OnePlus bit the dust in a tragic incident, I needed a new phone fast, and I couldn't afford to dish out $300-$500 for premium specs. So I decided to check out the lineup of Blu phones available at very inexpensive prices, expecting that it would be a ""holdover"" phone till I could get my next flagship (or flagship killer) device.The thing is, the sub-$130 phone I now have in my possession doesn't feel like a sacrifice. The look is eye-catching and sleek. I'm amazed at how thin it is. It has a nice weight in the hand. And where the device does cut corners, it's not as bad as you would think. The 720p screen is just fine to my eye. The quad-core mediatek processor isn't the greatest, but it holds up to music, games, watching YouTube videos, and most of the functions you would want to perform with your smartphone, with only the occasional stutter or lag. The storage space, while rather limited, can be expanded via MicroSD.Then, there's what really blows me away. The 4,000 mAh battery! Especially considering the thin and elegant look of the phone, it's hard to believe there's so much battery packed in this device. I can use the phone, rather heavily, from morning till night, and still have 75% - 80% left.I am beyond happy I got this for my replacement phone, and I would recommend it for anyone who wants a budget phone with premium good looks, decent specs, and amazing battery life. For the price, it's an absolute game-changer.",67.0,4

"Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Nokia,79.0,4,"I have used lots of different phones, from the basic Razr flip phone through several different Windows Mobile & Blackberry smart phones, and even the greatly over-hyped iPhone, and this is by far my favorite phone!Symbian has a lot better performance and stability than Windows Mobile. The Nokia 5800 is more fun than a Blackberry. And the iPhone? Well, it's really just a ""feature"" phone (aka dumb phone) posing as a smart phone. The iPhone is great for what it can do, but terrible for what it can't do.The Nokia 5800 XpressMusic is a truly useful and functional communication and entertainment device. It is the best convergence device I have used to date. It excels as a phone with great call quality and RF reception (I get 3G signals where other phones barely get 2G, or even no signal at all)! As a media device it features second to none audio quality (with good encoding and headphones it sounds incredible), and a truly amazing screen for photo viewing and video playback. And as a web/communication device it has one of the best mobile browsers available (full HTML with support for Java and Flash) with applications available for popular IM and social networking sites (ICQ, AIM, MSN, Yahoo, Jabber, IRC, Googletalk, Skype, Facebook, Myspace, Twitter and more) and email with support for attachments (POP, IMAP, SMTP, MFE). And since it's all controlled by the Symbian multi-tasking OS, you can use just about any combination of applications and features you want (within the limits of the phone's memory)!Nokia has been supporting this phone well with several major (free) firmware updates since it was released late last year. Be sure to update to the latest firmware, because there have been significant improvements in performance and stability, as well as new features added.It's small and light weight with reasonably solid construction. While it is a little thicker than some other touch screen phones, it is also narrower and has a very nice fit and feel in hand while not being overly bulky in your pocket.It's about as loaded as you can get feature wise. Besides what I mentioned above, it's got tactile (Haptic) feedback. Accelerometer. GPS with A-GPS and navigation software (Nokia/Ovi Maps). Dual-band high speed HSDPA 3.5G (WCDMA 850/1900 MHz) and multi-band international calling support (GSM/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900 MHz).

PC sync software.The 5800 XM runs on Symbian S60 v5, a true multi-tasking smart phone OS.

"Nokia E7-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, 8 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue)",Nokia,269.1,1,"Pros: Keyboard Great GPS/Navigation - Ovi Maps Big bright screen Solid Machine (slightly heavy) Great colors Easy setup for previous symbian usersCons: No voice navigation through Bluetooth headset or car kit Poor battery life Difficult Bluetooth pairing Software quirksThis is my 7th or 8th Nokia phone and I thought I had done sufficient research before purchasing but apparently not. I've had this phone 6 days and will probably return it in a week if it doesn't get better.I am a long-time Nokia customer, most recently the E71. The E71 is a great phone and although I wanted a bigger screen, I might just buy a new one if this E7-00 doesn't work out.This is my first touch-screen phone and all the reasons I didn't want a touch screen are present in this phone. The saving grace is the keyboard, which has a good feel to it and is very easy to type. The touch screen is so sensitive that I could blow on it and the keys activate. Very annoying. I read somewhere that the sensitivity can be adjusted, but haven't had time to find out if this is true.Upon receipt of the phone on Saturday, I immediately updated to Anna, thinking that would prevent the problems that others complained about. Unfortunately I think Anna comes with its own set of issues and I don't think that Nokia Customer Care is very forthcoming about.I have played around with the setting for the past few days, getting everything set-up and MAY be using it more trying to get everything setup than I would be as a regular user. I am trying to justify why the battery life has gone from 36 hours the first day, down to less than 8 on the 5th day. The only thing that I have running all of the time is Bluetooth. Wi-Fi is not continually on, internet use is maybe 30 minutes daily, may have 45 minutes of phone conversation daily and send at most 10 texts a day.....That should not account for the ridiculous battery life.I deleted the 3rd home screen and have tried numerous suggestions found on the internet to help with battery life, but so far it is getting worse every day.The biggest problem that I have with this phone is that you cannot hear the wonderful navigation system through the Bluetooth headset, nor apparently a Bluetooth car-kit. My own research over the past few days tells me that this version of Nokia Maps was designed this way, either listen over the E7 loudspeaker, or the wired headphones that came with the phone. As I usually have a few kids in my car, it is not an opportune environment for trying to hear anything, especially if you have to hold the phone to your ear, as the loudspeaker is not really loud. And why would I want to have a Bluetooth in my ear for calls and have to connect a wired headset to my other ear to hear the navigation.When I called Nokia to ask about the Bluetooth and Navigation issue, the rep didn't appear to know anything about it. After allowing her to link up remotely and resetting the phone (losing all of my settings, but not the data) she said that the problem was with my bluetooth and that I needed to get a Nokia Bluetooth headset in order to hear the navigation. This bothers me on so many levels, the first being that Bluetooth connectivity should be standardized. Secondly, I don't have the problem on my E71 using any type of Bluetooth. Why would a higher level and higher priced phone give you fewer options? Third, why are there so many complaints about this issue, but I have not once seen anyone offer that a Nokia Bluetooth headset will fix the problem.Although I am planning to buy a new Bluetooth (my new Jawbone is soooo uncomfortable), I would be pretty upset if I go through the trouble of buying a Nokia Bluetooth and it still doesn't work with the voice navigation.The Bluetooth issues continue as it is very difficult to pair with this phone. I've tried a new Jawbone, 2 month old Motorola, and various other Bluetooth from friends...same problem. It might take 9 or 10 tries before the pairing goes through. That is unacceptable.And finally the phone is resetting itself on a continual basis when I drive in certain parts of the city. It might reset 5 or 6 times within 10 minutes. I don't know if this is the phone, carrier or just my bad luck, but it is very annoying.Update 11/17/11 Phone just died. Phone is getting hot, cannot power off nor are any of the other buttons active. Nothing happens when you hold it down for 8- 15 seconds. Screen is white with black lines, almost like an old black & white TV when the horizontal tuning is messed up. Back it goes to Amazon. Hate it even more now. I have NEVER had a problem with Nokia phones before, but this is a piece of junk.",4.0,1

Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910T 32GB 4G LTE T-Mobile GSM Unlocked Smartphone White (Certified Refurbished),Samsung,289.0,1,"Okay. .. it took 4 phones to get one that's decent enough to keep. .. I would understand some of these things If they were used but they are supposed to be actually refurbished and I can guarantee you that these ""certified refurbished"" are not refurbished at all. ...Phone #1 : perfect in every way except the camera lens was so scratched you couldn't even take a picture I mean badly scratched just looking at the back of the phone you notice the damage easily so it was clearly not refurbished with such an obvious flaw. Seriously refurbished but they don't even test the camera?Phone #2 : Had a bad crackling speaker, damaged stylus and the water damage sticker was showing it had been wet at some point so if it was refurbished they would have put a new water damage sticker on right? Shouldn't matter is just a sticker right? But the fact I got 4 of them and know they aren't refurbished combined with the crackling speaker I'm pretty sure it really was water damaged. Plus the stylus didn't work. ... refurbishing and you don't even test the stylus hmmmmm....Phone #3 : Was not even the correct model number. .. the phone is advertised as a N910t however they sent me a N910t3 which still a note 4, is a different variant and takes different software than the regular n910t. One of the reasons I wanted the phone is because I can put android 4.4 back on it. (It's still my favorite) the t3 variant they sent me already been updated to 6.0 and couldn't go back to 4.4. The regular n910t that's advertised you can load whatever you want on it but not the t3 they sent me. ... also this stylus didn't work right either bummer.Phone #4 : It works and I'm keeping it but the sp02 oxygen saturation sensor doesn't work but not refurbished or it would all work. ......I'm just not sending it back again I'll deal with the broken sp02 sensor. ...Conclusion : not one of the 4 phones ordered had android 4.4 as it's advertised. They either had 5.1 or 6.0. If you get the one advertised the n910t you can roll back to whatever one you want but you can't go back with the n910t3. None of these phones were actually refurbished and with so many things to go wrong your really rolling the dice. .. gps, pulse, sp02, infrared, accelerometers, etc etc etc stylus etc etc there are so many things that can go wrong 2 cameras just so many things that can go wrong you buy a refurbished or new to avoid these problems but there's too many things to go wrong and these are not really refurbished . So when you get your phone make sure you test out every single thing to make sure it all works.",18.0,0

"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,149.99,5,"I get it. Phones are a personal choice and there are tons to choose from. People are very passionate with their opinions about which OS is the best. I think each one has lots to like. Over the last month I have decided to get back into bed with BlackBerry. I was a die-hard fan up to the pearl and said I would never leave. Well I did and became an android fanatic big time. I owned them all starting with the Incredible, bionic, 3 Nexus, 2 Notes, Thunderbolt, and both Moto X devices. Switched one time to BlackBerry back in 2011 for 1 day and hated the phone as it was so slow. I was done forever! I had some free time and started reading about Blackberry again and decided to check out the Z30. For $225 I could not go wrong. I was super impressed. The horribly slow phone I was expecting was really good. I read about the lack of apps. Not true. Amazon App store was good but I wanted more so I found an app called SNAP and had access to all the apps I used which are mostly financial ones and Google music. Some apps that require play services were not 100% compatible but worked.I then bought the Passport and love it. Beast of a Machine!!! Cannot say enough great things about it.Today the classic arrived and yes it will remind you of the classic blackberries you loved but it is now caught up with the times. This phone has a premium feel to it and has some heft which only adds to the quality feel. I have also found with the new 10.3.1.1154 update that some android apps I often use like Netflix and HP Print All In One remote are now fully functional. Netflix will now cast to my Samsung smart tv's and hp remote now allows me to print to my wireless printer and utilizes the scan function. The scanning is key for my business as I can scan docs directly to my phone!!! Internet browsing is speedy. I have compared this side by side with my passport and my wife's iphone. Browsing with the Passport is a tad faster and is equal to the iphone as far as uploading websites. I also use Microsoft's wireless display adapter which works flawlessly with my Blackberry phones. No more hooking up cables to my TV or projector. I just cast my screen to them both and can watch/listen to whatever is on my phone Doing powerpoint presentations is a breeze with this function. Battery life is exceptional and will easily get you through 1 day!! The ability to set short cuts with the physical keys is simply awesome and something I did not realize I missed from the blackberries of old. This is a huge time saver for me as I do not to search for apps and settings on my phone. If you are someone who has several email accounts and are on LinkedIn and Facebook you are going to love the HUB. You can easily access all of your messages and notifications in one place and it also has your text messages. I love this feature as I do not need to log into those accounts or apps to view my messages and notifications. Blackberry Blend is another great feature. If you are working on your desktop or laptop you can access everything on your phone (file, emails, texts, etc) and reply from your computer. I also have Sonos speakers throughout my house and was concerned that I would not be able to use my Blackberry to control them. The Sonos App works flawlessly with the Classic. Having spent the better part of month with 3 different Blackberry phones I would recommend these phones to anyone. I still have my Moto X 2014 Pure Edition and have not picked it up in 3 weeks and will be selling it soon as there is nothing I am missing since the switch to Blackberry. In fact I am able to even more with my new phones. One last thing of note I am on ATT and get LTE and the signal strength is the best of all my phones. If you are unsure about BlackBerry because you have read the negative reviews online or fear the company will cease to exist. I would say pick one up and try it and it may surprise you and be your next phone. Well done BlackBerry and thanks for listening to your customers and excited to see what you come up with next!!!",182.0,4

My advice, skip the purchase and (securely) purchase an overpriced flip phone from your carrier.

The battery life is below average, but the power save mode extends that quite a bit while still retaining most functions. The processor is very nice, video playback is seamless, and there are no skips while navigating. The thing that sold me on this phone is that it doesn't take up much real estate to carry. I can put this thing in any one of my pockets, and it doesn't feel awkward. In addition to living in the US, I travel to Europe, and Asia so the GSM compatibility is really nice.",0.0,4

For the first try at a touch phone, it's pretty good but there are just too many other touch phones that have already got the OS right.The Ovi store is still not worth going to. Only a few of the apps are even made for the 5800. And most of those were just ported over from the original app to be used with the 5800.The camera should be better. There is no excuse why a 3.2mp Nokia can't take a decent looking picture indoors.Overall I would say its a nice phone for the price but there are just too many phones out this summer to settle on this one.

Some saves to google play, some to the phone itself.-Constantly have to release ram and terminate apps.-Takes several seconds to send a text message.After about two months, I decided to switch back to iPhone.

Very happy that I made this purchase, anything with a 4.5 rating on Amazon is worth trying.Before you buy this phone, please make sure you know what you are getting. I read all the one/two star ratings before I made the decision, And I knew that they don't apply to me.I am a T-mobile prepaid users, and I spend most of my time in the office or home. So I only make a few phone calls each week, I use wifi at work to check personal emails and social networking, maybe one hour per day. So I don't worry about if 720p is not as good as 1080p, I don't really care. To be honest, I really can't tell the difference anyway. I bought a 1080p TV, and I was not impressed.Used to have a Samsung, this transition is smooth and I got a better phone with the same price. I used to keep a charging cable at work and home, now I only need one. And I don't think I need to bring one for short trips anymore.I won't recommend this phone to iPhone fans, I won't recommend any phone to iPhone fans, because they only buy iPhones, and they should not try anything else. iPhone has the biggest profit margin in all cell phones, as long as that doesn't change, they have all the money to invest.

"POSH MOBILE TITAN PRO HD ANDROID GSM UNLOCKED DUAL SIM 5.5"" HD SMARTPHONE EXTRA-large HD display, 13MP Camera and 8GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (Model#: E550 NAVY BLUE)",Posh Mobile,95.0,5," When I first saw the Micro X S240, I would have bet money that it was a toy phone for toddlers, letting them emulate their parents and older siblings with their real cellphones. But it's not a toy, it's a full-fledged genuine Android smartphone. Weighing only 1.85 ounces with a 2.4-inch display, it's by far the smallest smartphone that I've seen.To get the phone up and running, after removing the back of the phone, I inserted a micro-SIM (15mm x 12mm) and an 8 GB micro-SD card into the slots in the sides of the phone. Then I inserted the 650mAh battery. Before using the phone, I charged the battery with the included 5V/0.5A AC adapter, then turned on the phone. Connecting to my home wi-fi was quick. The phone came with about thirty preinstalled apps, and I downloaded and installed about a dozen more apps. Several of my apps required setting up with my user ID and password. Not being familiar with the tiny virtual keyboard that pops up when you need it, I was making a lot of mistakes. I tried using a stylus, but I found that I did better using my finger. Then it dawned on me to connect my Bluetooth keyboard to the phone's Bluetooth, and that solved the problem. Since then, I've gotten better at typing on the phone's keyboard, but if I had to do a lot of typing, I would use the Bluetooth keyboard. By the way, the little phone has Google voice recognition, which also can save on the typing.The phone came with Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) installed. One of the things I love about Android is that when I signed into my Google account, my phone contacts and Chrome bookmarks synced and were available immediately. The phone uses most of the Android conventions, such as the power/volume down buttons to take a screenshot.The screen display is 432x240 (160 dpi). That's much lower resolution than larger smartphones on the market today, but as a practical matter, I watched some sports and a few videos, and the images were surprisingly viewable for such a tiny display, although the visibility is somewhat dependent on the viewing angle, as I demonstrated in the accompanying video.With a 650mAh battery powering the dual core processor and the 2.4-inch (diagonal) display, I wondered about the battery life. I tested the battery by streaming full-screen video over wi-fi with the sound on low volume, and the battery lasted for 2:50. For typical mixed use of phone calls, web browsing, reading, music, and apps, I expect that the battery will last considerably longer than that. After draining the battery, I used the included AC charger to recharge the phone, which took about 2½ hours.The audio from the tiny speaker on the back of the phone isn't high fidelity by any means, but it's not too bad, considering the size of the phone. With no background noise, the maximum volume is satisfactory, but as with some phones and small tablets that I've used, you may want to have an auxiliary speaker handy if the ambient noise is high. A set of earphones is included with the phone; the earphone cable has a microphone that can be used for hands-free phone calls.The phone has front and rear cameras. The rear camera is 5.3 MP (3072x1728), with the front camera having 1.9 MP (1600x1200). The cameras have a limited set of camera controls, including autofocus and a 4X manual zoom. The camera also shoots 640x480 video, and you can zoom in or out while shooting. Overall, the cameras are nothing special, but they're okay. (Note: I determined the resolution of the cameras using benchmarking software. The numbers I got differ from those shown in the product description.)As I mentioned, I put a micro-SIM into the SIM slot. It was a prepaid SIM from a service that used T-Mobile in our area. I made and received some phone calls and text messages. The call quality was excellent. I did not purchase a data plan, so I was not able to test the GPS.After I inserted the 8 GB micro SD card, I used the phone settings to make the SD card the default for writing. The phone has 4GB of internal storage memory, and after you account for the operating system and the preinstalled apps, you're not left with a lot of available memory - about 2.5 gigabytes - so don't count on installing hundreds of apps. The micro SD cards are so inexpensive now that it just makes good sense to use one if you want to store a lot of books, music, videos, and apps on the phone. I connected the phone to my PC with the included USB charging cable, and it appeared in Windows Explorer as a USB mass storage device (as did the micro-SD card in the phone). That enables you to drag and drop files between the PC and the phone.I used the Antutu Benchmark app to see how the phone compared to other Android phones, and it scored 10,051. That's very low compared to high-end smartphones which score over 100,000, but it's actually higher than some current smartphone models. I'm not geeky enough to discuss the merits of the phone's 32-bit dual core 1.0 GHz CPU, but subjectively, the phone appears in most respects to be fairly responsive.The phone comes as part of a package which includes an AC power adapter and charging cable, and a set of earphones.The bottom line: It looks like a child's toy phone, but the Posh Mobile Micro X S240 is actually a surprisingly capable Android smartphone. It's definitely an eye-catcher. One of my teenaged nieces saw it sitting on a table when her family came by for a visit, and she had a fit wanting it. I may let her have it later, but not until I've had some fun with it. Okay, compared to a full-size phone, the Micro X S240 is awkward and slow when you're typing on its tiny keyboard, and the small display screen may challenge your eyes, but it's the most portable smartphone that I've seen, and I have to give it 5 stars for the ingenuity of the designers for cramming so much technology into such a miniature device. And yeah, the ""cute factor"" is off the charts.The phone was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.",3.0,4

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Platinum Gold,,594.89,1,"I purchased this phone for the expressed purpose of developing VR projects for Gear VR and Google Cardboard. I never expected or intended to use the phone features of the device. So I never added a SIM card much less carried it around or away from my office. After a couple of weeks the OS seemed to have crapped out and got itself stuck on some green terminal looking boot screen. Despite all my attempts to force a restart, perform a system restore, drain/charge the battery or whatever Android lets you do by holding in button X while closing one eye and whistling a happy tune, the phone just won't get past that Bootloader exception screen.I'm not an Android guy and since the purpose of the phone was to test apps, the device was required to be as close to stock as possible to adequately replicate the experience someone might have on their own device. By that I mean I didn't ""root"" the phone or mess with the OS beyond letting Android run all those auto updates it seems to do on a daily basis.I contacted Samsung US support and they said my phone didn't exist as far as they were concerned because it was obviously an international device. They told me to determine the country of origin and arrange service there.How convenient.I looked for some type of local resource that can service phones but it appears all that can be done are screen or battery replacements. Anything heavier has to go to the manufacturer...in Spain...or Antartica...or the Moon.I contacted the Amazon Marketplace vendor (Mobiles International LLC) that I purchased the phone from and they we nice enough in their correspondence and said:""Unfortunately Samsung does not provide warranty service on international unlocked phones. If you sent it to us in Miami, we can get a quote from a Samsung authorized service center to get the phone repaired. It looks like a software issue and should be fixable.""I FedEx'd them the phone and waited and waited. After two weeks or so I sent them an email wondering if there was any update.""At this time we have not received a quote unfortunately, the Samsung repair center here cannot repair your device because it is not Latin. We have one other option that we are trying. We will contact you as soon as we get a response.""And waited and waited...till about a month and half had passed and got this:""We received the unit back from Samsung this week. They returned the unit saying the warranty was void. We have shipped back to your address yesterday.""Huh? Is Samsung saying that I dropped it in a toilet? Or that I used my considerable phone hacking skills to circumvent their awesome software and install my own custom OS? No idea.So the lesson being, read the fine print. International unlocked phones may or may NOT come with a warranty. And even if you work yourself past that little detail and decide to roll the dice...if something goes wrong with your device there appears to be no recourse to have it repaired.Even if you expect to pay for said repair because the assumption being that a repair would cost less than the cost of a new phone there doesn't seem to be any reasonable way to facilitate getting it fixed. Waiting weeks and weeks to get some vague note about the warranty being void is hardly a workable solution.",75.0,0

Blu Dash JR D141W Dual Sim Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone,BLU,40.0,2,"I bought 2 of these phones as Christmas gifts for my kids. They are always asking to play Candy Crush or Talking Tom on our phones, so we decided to get them each one of their own. For the price, I thought this was a steal. After setting them up and trying to use them, I realized it was a robbery. Where my Note 3 takes a couple seconds to load Candy Crush, the Dash JR takes literally up to a full minute. Often times the kids would open it and just get some white screen. The market constantly crashed so downloading new games was impossible. I ended up returning them both and buying 2 of the Boost Mobile LG Volt. For $10 more each, I got a phone with Kit Kat (instead of Gingerbread which this phone runs), which has a much better front and rear camera (with flash), much faster processor, more RAM, much larger screen and everything works as expected.

Apple iPhone 6 Plus 64GB Gold (Factory Unlocked),Apple,615.0,5,"Bought from Apple Express Electronics and was satisfied with the promptness and courtesy of the seller. Item arrived new and sealed, as advertised! Came with a Verizon sim but hey, I'm glad the iPhone comes with CDMA and GSM antennas, so activating with AT&T was as easy as sticking in the respective sin and going through the usual activation process.The iPhone 6 Plus itself is HUGE, but everyone knows that by now. I do look at it in comparison with other phablets and think that Apple should rethink the top part to make the phone slightly shorter (maybe placing the front camera, the sensor and speaker all in a raw) or maybe rethinking the internal arrangement of parts. Other than size it is a very nice and slick looking device. Yes, some may say, base on the front panel, that it is just an iPhone but blown up. Although true, it is slim enough and the back (although probably inspired by the HTC M8) makes it look like a very premium phone. I personally miss the glass back of the iPhone 4 and 4S but can probably understand that said choice is more prone to cracked phones.I will not go into details on the performance of the phone. You can visit YouTube and just search for the details on that. However, I can say that it provides a very smooth experience going from one page to another, opening and exiting apps and accessing the control center and notification menu. This has to be taking into consideration as it is not as spec heavily as say the Galaxy Note 4 or the Xperia Z3 or many other android phones that have very impressing internals. Yet the iPhone works with what it has and works really good. The camera is still 8MP but the photos and videos are gorgeous. Maybe his is one of few reasons why Apple prides itself on quality and justifies its price tag. ...but I think the phone should be at least $50 cheaper for all models!IOS is simple and works well I a big phone. I wished it had home screen widgets and more customization options other folders but iOS isn't a broke OS. It works fine all around. I like finally being able to rotate my phone on the home screen (although a minor detail to some, it is more than welcomed and I think should be on all iOS devices). The bigger screen makes it easier for me to tipe and enjoy stuff in safari or other apps that are customized forbthebiphone 6 Pkus.The battery? I am charging my phone every 2 days with moderate use; day and a-half with heavy use.It's a good, solid phone! Recommend if you like simplicity and reliability, although warranted with a higher price tag.",4.0,4
"BLU Life One Unlocked Dual Sim Phone L120, 16 GB, White",BLU,120.0,5,"So far this is by far the best phone I have ever had. Fast and light but sturdy feeling. The included items were great.

I had heard a lot that the phone dims after 10 seconds but mine has not done that. I can play pretty much all the games, even the ones Google Play says aren't compatible. Pretty much full speed also. The battery life isn't the greatest but just as good as any other phone I've used.

"ASUS ZenFone 3 MAX 5.2-inch (2GB RAM, 16GB storage, 4100mAh), US Warranty Glacier Silver (ZC520TL)",,149.99,5,"This review is for the 5.5"" Zenfone 3 Laser, since there seems to be some confusion about which product people are reviewing. I bought this phone to replace a Moto G 4G (XT1045). This phone is a great deal at the $200 price point, and I have not found any major issues with mine.- SoftwareBefore I received this phone I was ready to write off the stock ASUS apps as worthless bloatware, but I'm happy to have been proven wrong. There are actually some usefull apps included stock that were not included with my previous phone Moto G, such as a file manager, flashlight app, laser ruler, and sound recorder. The Mobile Manager app is actually useful for managing battery and performance, keeping other apps in check. The battery drain notification is especially useful since it can let you know about an offending app early, instead of suddenly finding that your battery is in the red and you have no idea why. I haven't looked at any of the stock social or support apps yet. Some people have complained about wanting to remove stock apps, but I personally don't see much point. They don't auto-run so they aren't using any battery, and with 32GB of internal storage + 128GB uSD I am not exactly short on space. Note that this phone does not appear to support 'adoptable storage'. I'm not sure why they removed that feature from stock Marshmallow, but fortunately I didn't plan on using it anyway.- UII wasn't really sure what to expect from ZenUI having not been hands-on with an ASUS device before buying this one. Every vendor seems to be obsessed with differentiating through their UI, for better or worse. I figured worst case I could flash this phone over to Cyanogenmod in the near future if I hated the stock skin. However, I am happy to report that ZenUI looks and feels a lot like stock Android. People who are used to Samsung's TouchWiz may not like it. After using the Moto G for 2 years I had no trouble at all switching to this. I like that the flashlight and calculator are accessible from the pulldown menu on the lock screen without having to enter my passcode. However, I baffled that Power Boost (kills backgrounded apps to save memory) and Auto-start Manager (controls which apps can auto-start) are also accessible in this manner, as these are not apps that I would want a stranger to mess with. That's my only complaint about the UI.- BuildThis is my first phone >4.5"". I'm a fan of the larger screen when using it, but definitely not a fan of trying to bend over to pick things up while this is in my front pocket. With that said, the phone is very lightweight for its size. It is definitely lighter than my wife's Moto G 3rd gen despite having a larger screen and higher capacity battery. That does give me some concern about long-term durability, but so far I have no had any issue. External case material is metal, though I suspect this is just a shell over plastic since it does not feel or sound solid when tapped on with a fingernail. The ends of the phone contain the antennas and are encased in plastic. I generally hate phone cases and do not use them, but in this case the phone is slippery enough that I opted for a low profile rubber case from CoverOn. I definitely recommend this case to add some protection without adding much size.- ScreenThe screen looks amazing. It is bright and sharp. 1920x1080 is absolutely enough pixels for a screen this size. I have no complaints about this aspect of the phone.- CameraThe camera is great compared my Moto G, although I guess that isn't saying much. It's not like I'm looking for a replacement for my SLR, so to be honest my expecations weren't very high. I'll upload a few photos at a later time, but I'm sure you can find many other sample images in reviews elsewhere.- SoundThe phone has a single speaker on the bottom end. It would have been nice to have a second speaker on the top end for stereo in landscape mode, but that's asking a bit much for this price point. I see some reviewers have complained about it being quiet, but that has not been my experience. I keep my phone volume set 1 or 2 clicks up from silent and can easily hear it ringing on my desk from across the office at work. I suspect that those reviewers received defective units. The headphone jack, earpiece, and Bluetooth output are all in-line with what I experienced from my Moto G. I also have not had any trouble with lag during music playback like other users have reported. I use the phone every day to listen to music from the uSD card and it works great.My only complaint here is actually with the vibration; it is too subtle to work as a notification on its own. My Moto G would vibrate loudly enough that I didn't really need a notification tone. With this phone that is not the case.That's all that comes to mind for now. If I think of anything else, or if my experience changes significantly, then I will update my review accordingly.",40.0,4

Apple iPhone SE Unlocked Phone -16 GB Retail Packaging - Rose Gold,Apple,420.9,5,"Since so far I am the only reviewer with an iPhone SE, I see it as my duty to present this iPhone to you. Yes, I do have this phone (sorry I have in Rose Gold, but workmanship is the same) and I am writing a real review (pictures provided!).Okay, there has been a hype for about a few months now, and the new 4"" iPhone is finally here. Some important points to take note of are that this phone has the exact same body as the iPhone 5 and 5s. Literally the exact same. Unlike the 6s that was slightly larger than the iPhone 6, this iPhone will fit each and every case and screen protector made for the iPhone 5 and 5s. Really the only difference is that this phone comes with matte edges instead of chrome, and the legal labels on the back are removed.The next point was that this phone is better than the iPhone 6 (and much cheaper). Don't let the 4"" screen fool you, this iPhone's stats are mostly on par or better than the iPhone 6 (and no, bigger screen is not better). Take the resolution. 326 ppi, same as iPhone 6. A9 chip, better and faster than the A8 in the iPhone 6. If pictures are your thing, there is a 12-megapixel iSight camera, better than the one in the iPhone 6. Don't forget Improved noise reduction, also better than the iPhone 6. Don't forget the panorama that features up to 63 megapixels, you guessed it, better than the iPhone 6's 43 megapixels. Oh, and I almost forgot (not really), 4K video is a blast. For selfies, the iPhone SE now features Retina flash, or flash from the screen. Battery life: the iPhone SE has the best battery life of all iPhone for sale today in terms of internet use time.So should you upgrade? I will start with those without a contract. If you hold any iPhone with a 4"" screen or smaller, and you are free from any contracts, then yes you should upgrade. This includes current users of iPhone 1/3G/3GS/4/4S/5/5c/5s. Here's why. If you are without a contract, you probably paid more for your current phone than you will for this one. Given that you were able to afford a full price iPhone, you can definitely enjoy the features of this phone. The way I see it, this phone is the perfect way to enjoy an iPhone 6s without the huge cost (and the 3D touch).iPhone 6 users, this one is a 50/50 call. You really should be happy with your phone, but, then again, I pretty much just trashed your phone in the specs throw down above. This one is a tough call, and one you and your wallet should decide.Those with a contract, if your contract is almost over, rejoice, you can get this phone for free. But, since you are shopping on Amazon for this phone, I assume you are not in a contract. However, if you are still in a contract for a while, it is up to you to decide if this phone is worth breaking your contract over.I hope you enjoyed reading this review more than I enjoyed writing it. If you have any questions, my email is on my profile page, and you should feel free to contact me. I, however, am not a representative from Apple, and you might just get better answers there. Who knows?",15.0,4

BLU Studio 5.0 C HD - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Blue,BLU,2000.0,5,"I ordered this phone six months after spending $200 on an Alcatel one touch because it erased my memory card and I would have to reboot it at least 8 times a day to get it to acknowledge my sim card. Needless to say, I was very irritated and had next to no expectations outside of having a phone that I wouldn't have to reset whenever a stray wind blew by. So, I had the BLU shipped overnight and was happy when it was on my doorstep less than 18 hours later. I had no problems having my straight talk service switched over and syncing my new, very vibrant yellow phone. Its been a few weeks now and I couldn't be happier, this phone is everything its hyped to be. The speaker is loud, the picture is clear and crisp, the screen is incredibly responsive and gaming is awesome. The battery life is fantastic, I work 10 1/2 hour shifts all while listening to YouTube and I wind up having to charge it partially sometimes. Every other phone I've tried this with I've ended up charging every three hours or so. I use this device as a computer, an mp3 player, a camcorder, a camera, a television, a newspaper and a phone and it has surpassed all my expectations.

BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White,BLU,429.99,5,"I pre-ordered this phone after I bricked my OnePlus 1. I've only had this phone for 2 hours. So the review below is first impressions. Will update as I use the phone more.BuildI had read pre-release reviews that this is an exceptionally thin phone. I knew what to expect. But I was still pleasantly surprised by the form factor of this phone. It is incredibly thin and light that it almost feels like a dummy unit. With all the stickers and cellophane wrapping it came in, it initially looked rather cheap. But it is a beautiful phone once you remove all that.PackagingThe packaging is simple and unassuming. It comes with a charger, sim slot pin, ear phones and surprisingly a case and a screen protector.ScreenThe colors are good. But moving from a OnePlus the display quality felt a little lacking. But for the price and the form factor I can live with itConnectivityThis phone takes a nano sim (Not micro sim). I have no complaints with the wifi and LTE connectivity. This does not have wifi calling though.CameraThe camera is alright; nothing to write home about. This won't beat an iphone 6 plus camera anytime soon. But it is better than some android phones i've had.PerformanceThe phone out of the box is pretty fast. No lag was detected. After extended use and during charging the phone tends to warm up a bit.Cons- Some bloatware. Has opera browser, some email client and BLU help.- No SD card slot to expand the 16 GB memory- Camera could be better- No capacitive buttons.

Nokia 3710 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black),Nokia,269.1,4,"MY MOTOROLA KRZR K1 SHORTED OUT AND I AM A BIG FAN OF FLIP AND COMPACT PHONE. I KIND OF WANT TO BUY ANOTHER K1 BUTCANNOT USE SONGS FOR RING TONE. SO AFTER SEARCH FOR A FLIP PHONE I DECIDED TO PICK THE 3710. BOUGHT FOR $99 AT AMAZON WITH FREE 4GB MICROSD. BEST PRICE ON NET. I'M NOT A WEB OR TEXT TYPE PERSON. AND I HAVE T MOBILE PRE-PAIDED MINUTES. SO TO THE POINT . LOVE THE PHONE . SMALL AND COMPACT . THE BUTTONS ARE BIG AND HAVE A VERY GOOD TOUCH WHEN U PRESS IT. THAT WAS MY BIGGEST WORRY AFTER CHECKING OTHER CHEAP FLIP PHONE IN STORES. HAVE EVERYTHING I WANTED. A CAMERA, MUSIC PLAYER, EASY TO USE, ETC. ONLY ONE THING I HATE ABOUT THIS PHONE IS THE #$%@#ING BATTERY COVER IS A &^%* TO REMOVE AND INSTALL. THE COVER SLIDE IN AND OUT . THE PROBLEM IS IT'S VERY TIGHT AND THE COVER IS SILICONE LIKE SURFACE. TOOK ME 30 MINUTES TO REMOVE THE COVER AND REINSTALL IT. I HAVE TO USE A DAMPER CLOTH TO GRIP THE COVER AND PRESS VERY VERY HARD. NOKIA SHOULD JUST USE A BUTTON LATCH LIKE MY K1. LUCKILY THIS DAMN PHONE IS BUILD EXTREMELY TOUGH. THANK GOODNESS. I WAS SO PISSED OFF AND AFRAID I MIGHT BREAK THIS PHONE BY SQUEEZING SO HARD ON IT. I AM 5'10"" GUY. I WOULD HAVE GIVE IT A 5 STAR AND PLUS. BUT THE DAMN COVER. SO IF U ARE JUST LOOKING FOR A QUALITY FLIP PHONE, THIS IS THE BEST. SMALL THIN COMPACT. THIS IS IT. ONE MORE THING MAKE SURE U READ THE MANUAL TO INSTALL THE MICROSD CARD. U NEED TO SLIDE THE HOLDER INWARD AND IT WILL FLIP UP. DO NOT TRY TO FLIP IT UP WITHOUT SLIDING INWARD OR U WILL BREAK IT. HOPE THIS REVIEW HELP U . KEEP THE FLIP PHONE ALIVE AND WELL IN THE FUTURE.",7.0,4

As far as appearance, it was very sharp looking. Not one scratch or evidence of wear. After four hours, I finally got it powered on and had to immediately do the software update. I synced it to my phone and it was working just fine. I actually really liked how it worked with the phone..... Anyways, after I put it on my wrist, not even five minutes after removing it from the charger from a full charge, the charge dropped about 15% (I was not actively using the watch, it was on my wrist). Needless to say, that kind of made me mad. I decided to throw it back on the charger, and it powered off! it was stuck on no screen for over twenty minutes. I was super annoyed with it. Finally it turned back on and the charge dropped even more. At this point, I decided it wasn't worth the aggravation and that I was just going to return it. I'm just going to buy a brand new one.

Samsung Galaxy S6 32GB SM-G920i - Unlocked White (International Version),Samsung,459.99,3,"This was my first time ordering from Amazon. I ordered this Samsung S6 from Amazon because I wanted white and couldn't find it in any stores. I specifically wanted the S6 because it's the lightest weight, lighter than the S7 and the iPhone 6S. The phone is nice looking and stylish, and I love the pearl white color, but I'm a bit confused that the back of my phone only says Samsung, but does not display 'S6' like the other Samsung S6's that are sold here in America. The writing on the back is in another language, not English, so maybe it's made different in other countries? I have noticed the battery drains faster than my last Samsung S3 mini that I had for 3 years, and I have had the phone freeze up on me a couple of times and the screen turned black and locked up. I called Samsung customer service and they told me how to reset by pressing the down volume button and the button on the right side of the phone both at the same time for 20-30 seconds. I'm hoping that doesn't happen very often and has me a bit nervous. I'm past the time frame where I can return the phone now, so I hope I won't have any major issues since I paid $450.00, and would like to have it for at least 2-3 more years. Other than that, it's a nice looking phone, lightweight and does everything I want an android operating system to do.",0.0,0

With my life, my phone gets dropped on a routine basis. Without an Otterbox I would be going through phones every few months.This particular one is one of my favorites. Aside from being purple, which is a color I love, it's durable. The purple color is pretty true to the picture, at least on my screen. It's not lavender but it's not dark either. The white accents brighten the whole thing up. The charger port section is cut out so you don't have to worry about the flap tearing. The inner section is hard plastic and the outer section is a softer material. Despite being wrapped in two layers, the buttons work well and are easily used. The case fits snug around my Samsung S5. It's a real struggle to get it back off - which I think is a good thing as it means the case won't fall off. The clip is functional but I don't use it that often.

"ZTE Z431 Unlocked GSM Phone with 2.4"" Display, 2MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, GPS, SNS Integration, Muisic Player and microSD Slot - Black",ZTE,21.8,4,"I purchased this phone for several reasons and it has proven to be a great purchase. First, I needed a new MP3 player that was rechargeable, played for at least 12 hours per charge and would handle free library Overdrive books. My small clip-on Sansa disk players were great while they lasted, but completely unreliable. After the 6th $40 player quit after only a couple of weeks I gave up on them. I also needed a prepaid phone that would allow me to text with ease, but discovered that a prepaid plan for a smart phone was always at least $10/mo more, even if I never used data. I have a tablet and don't need an expensive smart phone too. With the unlocked Z431, for $30 I was getting a good MP3 player, a phone that made texting easy and only had one item to carry with me instead of two. In addition, this phone has bluetooth so I was able to ditch the earbuds with cords that kept getting in the way. I can use the phone for talking and playing books for several days without having to charge it (never done that with a smartphone). The phone was AT&T unlocked so I could get a free Sim from PureTalk USA which has a unique plan allowing me to pay as little as $10/month for minutes or automatically adds blocks of time if I need more, with extra minutes rolling over. I use anywhere from 200 to 800 minutes a month so this flexibility means I don't run out, and don't pay for minutes I never use as I did on a previous StraightTalk plan. The phone/media player is not perfect (hence 4 stars}. I wish it played wma as well as mp3 format books, but since most are available in both formats can live with that. A 5-star phone would also have a sleep timer and flashlight.Adding books was a definite learning process so I am including the steps to doing that here.1) You must purchase and insert a memory card.2.) Download the software and Overdrive books to your computer using your library site.3.) Connect the phone to your computer via USB and wait for Windows to load drivers4) Go to Computer to find the player symbol under Players with Removable Storage and double click5) A window with ""U Drive"" should pop up. Single click (important) on U drive.6) Wait for a couple of minutes - it takes time to load and I was sure it was not working the first few times I tried it because I did not wait long enough. The first file menu that pops up is for the phone, when a second longer menu appears you will be able to use the Overdrive transfer option from your computer to get the files on to your phone.These steps were from my Windows 7 computer.Other things I like:The calendar with audio reminders of my appointments.The keyboard that I find easy to use in spite of the tiny keys. Maybe it works because the keys are raised. The numbers are small, but since most of the phone numbers I call are stored, I rarely have to enter a phone number.",24.0,3
BLU Studio C Super Camera -Unlocked Smartphone - US GSM- Pink,BLU,99.96,5,"This phone definitely rivals the more expensive Samsung Galaxy. The camera is truly a wonder! It has amazing filters, and even without a filter the picture is captured clear and in high definition. The largan lense really does take wide photos, so more background/scenery/people fit in photos! It works excellent in low light, and the flash is excellent.The dual-sim card feature holds both a mini sim card and micro sim card. The screen shows excellent colors at high definition.The storage is amazing!! The phone has 8GB for storage, but after 3GB are used for the Android operating system, there is still a lot of room for apps, etc. The phone can hold a micro sd memory card for my storage space. I currently have 15 apps installed, and still have almost 2GB of storage left.This is definitely a modern and high tech smart phone. The processor is fast, the apps all run fast and download quickly. The email is easy to set up.The call volume is somewhat on the quieter side, even at max volume, but, this is isn't a problem if you just hold the phone higher up on your ear.The phone itself is thin and lightweight. It charges quickly, a full charge in less than 3 hours. The battery lasts about 2 days of constant use (I mean CONSTANT, like I could not put this amazing phone down) and about 4 days when it's on standby.Definitely recommend for a great unlocked smartphone that is comparable to the name brands Samsung!! I would buy it again a million times over!!",2.0,4

Samsung Galaxy Y GT-S5360t Unlocked GSM Quadband Phone - Grey(International Version No Warranty),,84.0,5,"I absolutely love this phone. I don't do much more than calling and texting, so if you don't use too much data, then this phone is great for you. Though I don't use it for much more than it's phone capabilities, plenty of apps work with it, and surfing the web and listening to music are very easy. Simple games like solitaire are great, but games like Angry Birds are best played on something with a bigger screen, though.The most impressive thing for me is the battery life of this phone. I have an iPod touch and am frequently in WiFi zones, so I use that for web surfing and apps most of the time. Because of this, and also because of the phone's efficiency, one single charge lasts for days on the Galaxy Y. I recently checked my battery life, and on one charge I had gone over 6 days (with regular use) and still had 19% of the battery remaining.If you want a smartphone but cash is tight or you are a phone minimalist such as myself, I highly recommend this phone for you.",25.0,4

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 64GB - Pearl White - GSM - US Warranty,,349.99,4,"Got the phone during thanksgiving sales. What an amazing device for the price! I can see why people pay much more for iphones because they like the IOS, but for people using Android, I don't see any reason why anyone would pay double/triple the price for a Samsung or Pixel phone. There is no way Samsung can compete for the price/quality. Samsung would only survive because of the carriers' protection.Now that carriers all ditched 2-year contracts, I can see Honor or some other cheap (but great) phones take over the Android market.Pros:- Beautiful design: I think it's even prettier than the Iphone- Fast: it may not have the fast CPU, but it's very fast for everything I use. No hiccups anywhere.- EMUI: some people don't like the UI on top of the stock Android. I think that's personal preferences. I happen to like the UI, lots of small but very useful features, good battery management tool. No App drawer similar to IOS, but I don't really care, just create folders to organize Apps. No complaints about the EMUI so far.- Battery: good side is that it's much better than my Samsung phone (even after I got a new battery for my Samsung). Good standby battery management. I tested it one night, during my 8 hours of sleep, battery dropped 3% from full charge. With normal usage, you can get 5-6 hours of screen on time.Cons:-Battery: I talked about the good side, but I wish the battery is 20% bigger. It's already a very thin and light phone, adding 20% battery wouldn't make it bulky, but it will go a long way. I played Pokemon once awhile (~45 mins total time), it can drain battery quickly. With Pokemon playing time, I only get about 4 and 1/2 hours total screen on time. Not too bad, but may not last me a day. Again, wish the battery was bigger.Overall, an amazing phone. To be fair in terms of battery cons, there are not many phones with large batteries nowadays. Iphones have good standby time, but if you play Pokemon, they are still not enough. I hope the phone makers make the phones slightly thicker with a bigger battery!",,4

"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)",Samsung,29.99,5,im very impressed with this phone.the battery life was a huge importance to me since i have had terrible luck with battery life in the past with other phones.especially blackberrys..it lasts atleast 15 hours on average!! it does take a bit longer to charge because it does have a large battery pack.but since smartphones use more power.it kinda needs the large battery.browsing the internet on it is amazingly fast and doesnt crash back to the home screen a lot like the iphones have done to me so many times.the speaker phone is loud and clear.the display is extremly beautiful.wow.the only thing i wish it had wich is no big deal is have a front camera because taking a pic turning the phone around decreases accuracy.but oh well everything else makes up for it.there are so many pros than cons.i have my xbox live account synced with it so when i tap the xboxlive app tile it shows my avatar.i can customize that right from the phone.look at whos on there xbox and what they are playing! you can even write them messages to them on there xbox from your phone! the flash is very bright.it can even make taking pics outside in complete darkness and light up everything in the photo unlike a lot of phones that light things up but not like its daylight.everything about this phone destroys apples iphones in every way to me except the library of apps.they have the important ones to my liking.but they are growing!! my facebook is synced with my contacts list and so every contact i put in is link with there facebook with everyones status update next to there names and profile pic.this phone is just convenient in a lot of ways.i totally recommend it.,0.0,0

"CNPGD [U.S. Office Extended Warranty] Smartwatch + Unlocked Watch Cell Phone All in 1 Bluetooth Watch for iPhone Android Samsung Galaxy Note,Nexus,htc,Sony White",CNPGD,49.99,2,"I don't think I've ever received and decided to return a product so quickly.I'm a biker who just upgraded to a phablet, which is cumbersome beyond reason to carry on the bike. An mp3 watch seems like the perfect solution (yes, an mp3 player might be simpler. However I don't always have pockets, I hate arm bands, and I hate clipping things to my clothing. I know, first world problems). An option for communicating in case of emergencies might also be nice, so an mp3 watch it is. So all I'm really looking for is an mp3 player that's easy to wear, with a time function and possibly texting in a pinch, not a device to be my new best friend.I first tried a GT08, which seemed to work nicely but it bothered me when I noticed I had paid twice as much as I should have (the problem with these Chinese knock-offs is the same product is available from different sellers at vastly different price points). Plus I really disliked the ""nucleus"" menu style, so thought I'd try a different model.There was a lot to like about the CNPGD. Right out of the box, the silver metal finish looks very high quality and the band is much nicer than the GT08, very supple and comfortable. The menus are much cleaner and easier to navigate, having only 4 rather than 8 (mostly useless) options per screen. It let me transfer all my music into the required ""my music"" folder (something I suspect all these watches have in common to use the music player from your SD card) via PC, much more painless than the GT08 that made me hand select each song from the watch screen individually to move (note: I had to reboot the watch for it to find them, a minor inconvenience since the boot sequence is very quick).However, the love affair ended instantly when I realized to my dismay there was no shuffle option to be found anywhere for the player. I really wish if this isn't to be a standard feature that it would be mentioned in the item description. Who wants to listen to their playlist straight through in alphabetical order? Stupidest omission on an mp3 player ever.Another maybe not so small complaint is there seems to be no way to change the truly ugly watch face -- tapping the screen (which the GT08 required) did nothing, and I couldn't find any theme settings anywhere (not like there are a ton of places to look).So the search continues. Thank goodness for Amazon's painless return process, however I'm now out $12 in return shipping fees. If my third attempt is a bust, I may have to start considering something in a much higher price range (although from what reviews I've read on a few products, that's not necessarily a guarantee of quality either).",1.0,1
Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - US GSM Unlocked Phone,Motorola,89.99,5,"amazing phone, not what I expected !(I'll probably make a lot of mistakes because English is not my native so i apologize in advance)the biggest advantage of this phone is not the price, but what you actually get for the price:please notice that this phone should be mainly used as a PHONE not a weird pocket gaming console or portable PC or some kind of relic of prestige, it is designed to pack everything you NEED the most, without loss of quality.design and hardware:pros: the weight/size ratio of the phone is superb for me, its back cover design is very ergonomic, some people find it to be heavy but i like the weight, it makes you feel that you are actually holding something. the screen is superb, it is truly scratch resistant, display quality is also great, you won't notice any pixels unless you use magnifying glass to look at it for some reason, packing more ppi pixel density into display doesn't make sense to me, what's the difference if the eye sees almost the same image? (unless you are casting your phone screen on HDtv for some reason) because it packs less pixels than high end displays, it also needs less powerful gpu to make everything work, so i do not consider adreno 302 chip to be a drawback. neither dual core cpu, which also handles software easily. the micro sd slot is very useful, i prefer using sd card over internal memory because you can easily remove card and plug it into something else, and because sd cards are so cheap and easy to get, adding about 15 $ will get you a phone with 4(internal) +32gb memory. phone has 1 Gb of ram, android 4.4.4 runs with absolutely no lag, amount of background apps can be up to 3-4 without noticeable difference in performance.cons: the camera. i could debate about this topic, because non-existent selfie camera on front perfectly suits selfies that i never take anyways. I don't like paying for features that i never use, but that's me and absence of front facing camera is drawback for most users. the rear facing camera is a peace of crap. but it is that kind of peace of crap you will find useful anyways, main idea of having camera on phone, in my opinion, is to quickly take it out of your pocket and shoot photo of something special that you really need to. you won't be able to take high resolution photo, but 5 megapixels is enough for small size printing and for most mobile phone screens, i hope that the readers do understand that same camera with 30 megapixels has little to no advantage over 5 megapixels in most cases, if not please read this : http://www.tomsguide.com/us/how-many-megapixels-you-need,review-1974.html aside from megapixels the camera is still a peace of crap. no autofocus - this basically means no 100% sharp images, BUT you wont notice it unless you are taking macro shots. and it is possible to take 100% sharp photos at certain distance from camera, provided that you always have tape measure in your pocket and time to quickly measure distance from your phone to object and only then take photo. !!! forget macro shots, it is simply impossible with this phone. no flash as well. BUT you will be able to take OK and printable photos in well-lit situations, a bit of basic knowledge about photography also helps a lot.software: phone runs latest android version 4.4.4 and is promised to be compatible with android L, well, that's a BIG deal, for me the most important part of phone is software and apps, and this phone can handle all of it, without noticeable difference in performance compared to other pricey smartphones out there, if you treat it well and limit your use up to 3-4 apps running at the same time, there will be absolutely no difference between this phone and high-end android phones. apps provided by motorola are also useful.now for those that never used android phone, you greatly benefit if you are google customer, which i am, and google integration means A LOT for me. my life is so much easier because of it.final verdict: if you agree with at least most of my review just buy it already, srsly, do it!",2.0,4

Verizon Samsung Convoy U640 No Contract Military-Spec Rugged 3G MP3 Phone,Samsung,159.99,5,"This is a great little phone, very sturdy and has everything I need.I'm old school and originally I was dragged into the cell phone age kicking and screaming. I hate talking on the phone as it is, but having one with me all the time when my only saving grace before was being able to say I wasn't home as an excuse to not answer, was just unheard of. But... kick and scream I did and here I am. I started out using the brick with a telescope antenna, then went to the flip phone, then eventually graduated to the smartphone. Out of all the phones I've had with me, The Convoy U640 is the workhorse I enjoy having with me the most. Sturdy, reliable, and it does everything I want in a phone. The TXT features on it are not Qwerty, but that's okay. They're easy enough to use once you get used to them. I only text my wife when I'm at the grocery store anyway.Out of all the smartphones and former flip phones I went through, the Convoy has the absolute best signal grab. I hear the person on the other end much more clearly than any phone I have ever used, anywhere I go in Verizon's coverage area. And likewise, my wife has told me she can hear me much better when she's talking to me on the phone now. For that, and the sturdiness (I've dropped it a couple of times, and the phone just keeps on smilin') I give it a full 5 stars.It's got all sorts of stuff on there I hardly use. Just for the heck of it, I downloaded a couple of games and played them during the down time when waiting on kids to get out of school (good sound and display) and use the alarm clock feature with a downloaded piano ringtone by Chopin and the sound is awesome. Heck, even the camera takes a pretty good picture when you have it set to its largest size setting!All in all, very well worth the money if you're not into Smartphones!",0.0,4

After several falls, I firmly believe this is a feature and not a flaw, sort of like crinkle zones on a car, it is supposed to fall apart in order to absorb the shock. Two peeves, the on/off button is a pain to work because it is flush with the surface, and I get that so you don't accidently turn it off and on, but there has to be a better way. The camera is rather sucky; resolution is poor and pictures are always darker and not very defined.

I didn't realize that the international version had dual sim, but that's great, I can just pop a new sim when I travel. I noticed too that the seal was broken on the phone but reading from Android forums, this was necessary to activate the phone in the country of origin (Mine was apparently from Africa) before it could work internationally. The downside to it being from an international phone is that I couldn't register it on Samsung's website. I haven't tried going to the Samsung Africa website... Having been an iPhone user, I quickly found out how much more iPhone apps there were than Android's but there were equivalents, and those that don't... well, they weren't that important to me. Most of the productivity apps do have an Android equivalent. The UI didn't bother me too much because I have an Android tablet but if you were loyal to Apple and are suddenly switching it may take a few minutes/hours to orient yourself with the capabilities of this device and of the Samsung and Android interface.

Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Mist Blue (US Warranty),Sony,499.99,5,"This is one of the few flagship phones that still comes in a compact form factor, but with the smaller size you're not actually giving up much at all. It's also cheaper than a lot of other flagships to boot. Battery life on this is amazing, probably close to 8-9 hours of screen on time. If it doesn't get used much all day, then it'll easily have over 80% charge left at night. Reminds me of old Nokia phones in that regard: excellent battery life and power management.The build quality is really solid. The screen is mildly curved on the edges (but not nearly as much as many other curved screens), giving it that little bit extra of a 'fancy' feel. The white color is also really unique. Doesn't come with a lot of bloatware at all, it's quick, snappy, multitasks well, and the camera is pretty fine too.Overall, probably the single best option if you're looking for a compact flagship-level phone in 2016 (and likely well into 2017), and actually gives many full-sized flagship phones a run too.",6.0,4

However, the tablet came with a warning on the tape to open the box - if one connects to TMobile, then one agrees to the 1 year contract and terms of service. The first thing that I did was to remove the SIM card. (Note that the SIM card was already installed even though the instructions tell you how to install your SIM card - a bug or a feature?). I was in no way going to be accidentally connected to a server and contract I do not want. The tablet seems to want a sim card, claiming some features are not available. I have not found any information about how to 'unlock' the tablet or to remove the TMobile introduction with their jingle. I am assuming that removing the SIM card is the way to unlock the tablet and if I did want to connect I would purchase some other company SIM card. TMobile may be a nice company but I do not want this tablet connected to a data plan and would like to pass on their sign-in message. Any help on this would be appreciated.",0.0,3

I often root the phones and whatever else so I have patience. I have to say that out of the box this phone was trying my patience. I purchased the phone February of 2016 and in the first couple weeks it worked alright. I get a good strong battery life out of the thing so that is fine with me... aside from the Chrome browser that seems to constantly be draining the battery. Trouble was all the constant freezes and glitches. These were not the normal android bugs either... This was problems like taps not registering, notification panel freezing, and then locking up to the point where the only option was to restart the phone. That is pretty unacceptable for the everyday user; I worked at a cell phone company and people would complain when you asked them to do it for troubleshooting reasons. Recently there was the march 2016 update and it seems like the changes are for the better. I haven't had a time that I was forced to restart since then. I love the phone and shouldn't be so critical but my complaints were the reasons I couldn't give this 5/5.Quick Round+Bleeding edge nexus phone+Good size for pockets and hands+Pretty zippy when it wants to be-Occasional freezing and restarts-Terrible selection of accessories-I bought through here instead of google and lost out on price drop",1.0,2

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Black (U.S. Warranty)",Asus,235.16,2,"After using it for a few months, it has some issues that is still not resolved. It has a pretty good screen. The 64GB memory is great along with the SD card expansion option. Processor is pretty fast. Double tap to shut off the screen doesn't work unless you use Asus' launcher app. The design would have allowed them to have a removable battery, I don't see why it wasn't done. The Asus cover is actually useful but as with any cover, it interferes with picture taking. The Asus clock cover blocks the flash. I like the Quickcharge 2.0 compatibility. Even with the smaller capacity battery, the quick charge make it easy to keep it charged and ready. Quickcharge 2.0 accessories are a great option. Asus needs to be faster with the updates. It's up to Android 5.0 as of 8/9/15 and Nexus is already up to 5.1.1 with security fixes. The problem I have been running into is the Asus version of Black Screen Of Death. Every once in a while the system would slow down like it was in a queue and buttons will not respond. Then it would speed up to do all the commands you have pressed. Then it goes into a black screen. most of the time you can just hit the home button and it will be back to normal. Sometimes it would require a hard reboot. I checked Asus' zentalk forum and it has been described there a few times by users since the end of May but no response. I figure a bad review here would get Asus' attention.Update 10/6/15After a few back and forth with Asus rep, the wanted me to send the phone back. But since I have nothing to use as a backup, I have to find another phone to use or pay $25 for them to send a temporary phone first. The phone still freezes. I've ordered a Nexus 6P so I will end up sending the phone back for repairs after I get my nexus phone. A few weeks ago, I got an amber alert. I looked for ways to turn it off but it seems like Asus did not put in that ability. I emailed Asus support and the guy didn't know what I was talking about. He thought the Amber alert was some type of colored alert. I tried to explain again in my email and never heard back from Asus support again. That was two weeks ago. Taking off a star for the issues with this phone. The lack of amber alert and other emergency alert controls is just bad design. The freezing is really just bad. The iffy support sinks it more.",1.0,2

I had the OnePlus One since release, but had to get rid of it is it has screen and software issues. Was hesitant to go back to OnePlus, but they really delivered.The phone is extremely quick, and can handle anything you throw at it. Although, it did get a bit hot at times while on Reddit or Facebook.Camera is, well, okay. 13MP sounds nice, but it's just not galaxy s6 or iPhone 6S quality. Really does well in lowlight, though.Battery life is amazing. I Easily get at least a day and a half out of this phone. Same as OPO.Only thing I didn't like was ---no NFC--- for the one time I had an urge to use Android Pay.Overall, if you're looking for a cheap phone that competes with the big dogs in the current market, but still at an affordable price, then this is your go-to phone.",5.0,4

"Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-i9195i Unlocked Cellphone, Retail Packaging, White Frost",Samsung,276.37,5,"WOW. This phone actually fits in your hand! Although it has a 4.3"" screen, it is narrower than the original Galaxy S1 (Captivate, Vibrant, etc.) as well as the Galaxy S3 mini. What else? Great specs! This is a really fast and powerful phone, WITH an MicroSD card slot. While not as fast as the full-sized S4, it is faster than the S3, and many other phones on the market. That, along with TouchWiz UI, plus the option to install CyanogenMod (Stock Android ROM), and you have a really nice phone. The only cons are the screen resolution and the bundled software. The screen is not HD, but really, it's fine. 16:9 videos look great and fit edge-to-edge. As far as software, the phone comes preloaded with a lot of garbage that cannot be removed without rooting, but it still runs fast, and the apps can be hidden from the app drawer.

This thing just WILL NOT DIE. Fell out of my pocket on my bike. gets nailed by a pickup going 30, gets scattered down 100 yards of asphalt. Put it all back together (just the battery case popped off) and it was fine. Slipped and banged my lip really hard on a counter corner *** do not read if you have a weak stomach *** bad enough that I needed sixteen stitches. I get on the phone with my mom to have Her come take me to the hospital (still in high school back when I had this) bleeding rather profusely into the toilet. phone slips through my bloody fingers into the toilet. I snatch it out after a couple seconds of frustrated cursing. Not only did it still work, the damn thing hadn't even dropped the call and I was still getting crystal clear reception. ***End nasty part*** even when I was getting frustrated with an ex, and hurled the phone across the room when she text dumped me, it broke in half. Screen came clean off. I called her, clicked the speaker phone button, and it still. frickin. worked. And thats besides the dozens of other drops onto hard surfaces that would leave a modern phone in splinters. This is the phone I would take into any situation, anytime, anywhere. You know in the movies where like a cell phone stops a bullet? THIS, is that cell phone. It lasted me nearly 6 years, and when I traded it in for a new phone (smart phone takeover and all) I buried my old one back at my parents place like a pet. Most indestructible thing I've ever had. That nokia phone that people joke is like as strong as Thors hammer? The unstoppable force? That phone hitting this one would end the universe, for this is the immovable object.

"Yezz Andy 3.5E2 Unlocked Android Phone, with interchangeable colors back covers - Orange",Yezz,52.72,5,"I bought this for my coming trip to Europe, intended for call, text, and map using an European SIM card. Right now, I cannot evaluate call quality nor 2G/3G connection, because I don't have a GSM SIM card in US. Other than that, so far, the phone seems very solid.First, I want to clarify that this phone is no way near Galaxy or iPhone. But, for basic phone functionalities, it is very good option.The OS is a lean version of Android 4.With Android and a few apps, there is still 1.8 GB space left, out of the 4GB on-board storage. And, when idling, the RAM is only 50% occupied. It responds well to my operations or when loading Google maps. And, when leaving it idling in WiFi connection for 24 hours, the battery only drops 10%, which I think is due to the lean OS.The touch-screen is very responsive. No significant lagging nor missed hit. The WiFi connection is also fast.In addition, I also likes the phone's back covers. I ordered a black one, and it ships with an extra red one. The back cover feels like rubber and has texture built on it, which prevents it from slipping. I don't need to buy a case.The graphics are not so good. The resolution is just enough to render nice icons or show maps. However, the color is dull like old TV. And, you cannot see clearly in wide angles.I will update on call quality after my trip. Other than that, I think this is solid basic phone, which happens to use Android to save software development. And the price is nice, cheaper than a lot of old school phones. Yet, I wouldn't consider it as a Modern smart phone, because it doesn't have the processing power or graphics to meet smartphone demands.",2.0,3

"Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini G800F Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, 16GB, White",Samsung,229.0,4,"Update, April 2016:I should have updated months ago, but basically within 2015 (less than a year since purchase) the phone slowed down a good bit. At the moment, in April 2016, I still have it but it's much slower still. It seems to stall for a few seconds when doing simple things -- touching any icon to launch an app, trying to snap a pic, trying to enter a web address or search item into the browser search field (the keyboard takes several seconds to come up). It's unfair they seem to go noticeably wonky after just a few months of use, especially after the price paid. The camera issues started in under 6 months.I've removed one star because I don't think these phones should degrade so quickly with controlled to moderate use.--Quad core is the way to go. This thing moves fast! The touch sensitivity is very good, apps and internet function smoothly and very quickly (internet might depend on your mobile data service, or wifi quality). And I can attest, from personal experience, that the water-resistant feature WORKS WELL! -- I had a bit of an accident, where the phone was in water for a few seconds, but was back to normal after drying. The speaker took a few days to start working as it did (sounded scratchy because it needed more drying time), but after that, it was back to perfect. Purchased around Dec 2014.",0.0,3

Unfortunately this phone acts more like a prototype to anything nokis/MS has released recently.Aesthetically it is very sleek and thin. A pretty decent size screen. I would say in this department the 925 is more appealing than any Iphone prior to the 6.The camera is very nice and for a phone that is already pretty dated it competes with newer phones.The phone though has bugs. Within in 6 months this is going to be the second time I will be replacing the headphone jack due to it being damaged. I'm not sure what is causing this. I have never had this problem with any previous phones. I figured the first time it was due to bad habits such as leaving my headphones in the jack while not in use or maybe accidentally twisting the headphones. It could be that my sol republic headphones are causing this but regardless if that is the case I did not have this problem with the 710. I used sol republic, cheap gummy JVCs, scull candy and other headphones with my 710 and never came across this problem.Second within the last month my phone no longer flips the screen depending on my position. For most apps I now have to keep my phone horizontal at all times. The camera is not affected by this luckily. Also the home screen and certain apps function vertically.Overall I'm not too satisfied. I like my 925. But in my advice I would suggest you to pay a little extra for the 1020 which is probably a much more completed product",3.0,2

"Nokia Mural 6750 Unlocked GSM Flip Phone with Second External OLED Display, 2MP Camera, Video, Bluetooth, MP3/MP4 Player and microSD Slot - Silver",Nokia,269.1,3,"I bought this for my Mother, as she rejected the smartphone and specifically asked for a ""flip phone."" After showing her a few options on the computer, she wanted this one. It is a little more expensive than I would have liked, but it worked with H20 wireless and she liked the look of it.After 9+ months with the phone, here are the pros and cons I have heard from her (as I have just replaced the phone - at her request)Pros:- It looks really nice. Especially the way that the screen on the top/outside of the phone can light up when it is closed. She was impressed by it, and so was it. Best looking flip phone I have seen.- If the sun isn't directly behind you or over your head, the numbers and screen are relatively easy to read and use.- It was plenty loud enough for her.- Everything besides the back panel seems to be well made.Cons:- Major one is that the back panel would keep falling off continuously. The little slider latch seemed to always slide open unintentionally, causing the back to fall of randomly. One of these times the little metal hinge-like pieces got a little bent out of shape, and had to be re-bent. The metal isn't very strong, so it bends easily. But after that, it was even more difficult to keep the back on. This was a constant issue for my Mom.- In the wrong lighting, the screen and keypad is very difficult to see.Ultimately, when I was recently given an old flip phone and proceeded to ask my Mom how she was doing with hers, she answered by telling me that she had lost the back of the phone a couple of days ago (somewhere in her car she thought) and thus hadn't been using the phone. I then offered her this other flip phone, and she promptly accepted. So while the phone looks really nice, and is unlocked, if you're not attentive about the back panel it could become frustrating like it was for my Mom.",1.0,4

"Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803 16GB 4G LTE 4.6"" Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Black - International Version No Warranty",,244.0,1,"First things first, I think this is probably the best phone out there. Right up until the glass breaks. And it WILL break. This isn't an occasional defect, but a systemic issue with the quality of materials used and Sony's quality control. This issue is posted on every forum online, and I should have paid attention. Mine was just in my pants pocket when it happened. The phone went in my pocket without a crack, and after a strenuous workout of walking and sitting, came out with one. Of course, these things happen, right? Well, Sony's solution is to have you call them (I started by trying to contact them online, but they said I had to call) and that they will ""evaluate"" it, provided you are able to be without your phone for 2 weeks. No loaner program, so now I have to beg around for a phone that I can use in the interim. At the end of this period, of course, they may just say that it was my fault and tell me how much it is for them to repair it (probably with more of that faulty glass that will just break again). So now, because they used cheap, flimsy glass, I have to be without a phone for 2 weeks before they will tell me that I may have to repair it. You'd think after the *literally* thousands of claims of this happening that they would have something in place to make it so you don't have to be without the phone for 2 weeks. What a way to ruin a really good phone. I was ecstatic that a company out there was finally realizing that no phone should be so big that I would have to carry around a man-purse (or satchel, as Indiana Jones may justify), so it's such a let-down that this ended up being such a bad experience. I'll see what happens and revise my review when I get through the process.",11.0,0

Also, when I finally first turned on the phone everything was in Chinese, and some text still stay in Chinese even after I changed the setting to English, I'm still not fond of the huge foreign charger with adapter that came with the phone. This phone was also not sent to me within 3-5 business days of ordering, which was when I needed it before my trip. I also saw this phone online now for a lesser price and twice the storage.

Had trouble with switching my straight talk service to the phone and that lasted for about 3 weeks both switching and getting my data to work properly. After getting the phone situated everything was fine until recently. I have been experiencing glitches with the phone which is weird because the only things I use on the phone are the apps already on the phone as well as Spotify and Soundcloud. My phone will automatically play my music when it is paused, as well as stop the music if its playing. It's so strange because I do have premium accounts and it wouldn't just freeze and stop playing the music out of no where. At first I thought it was my data, so I called straight talk to get it fixed, but my data is working fine and I have full range where I am, so it's not my data. I really don't know why this is happening and if I'm the only one experiencing this. But right now I don't know what I want to do about the phone because it is a perfectly great phone. Really the glitch is the only thing wrong with the phone right now. So I'll give it 4 stars.",2.0,3

And for this to happen the first day... Big disappointment.. I contacted Samsung they said they can't take the phone for repair, even if I am willing to pay whatever it takes, because it was an international version ! I still recommend this phone, I would rate 5 stars for the internals, features, stylus, camera, productivity, but these two stars are for the falsly advertising the corning Gorilla glass being very hard ! May be it is my phone from a bad batch...

Asus cover feature was enabled not allowing me to get into the phone, after struggling for 2 days I contacted Asus over the phone. they offered me to replace the phone with a refurbished one and charge $25 as processing fee. Why on earth would you charge the customer for your defective model? The sensor that senses the flip cover is really faulty in this phone. And if it is not disabled as soon as you buy, you may land up in my situation.I would not suggest to buy this phone unless you want to spend $25 on processing fee for replacement phone.Additional Comments 3/25/2016: After spending weeks without phone I got a replacement refurbished phone from Asus only to find that the SDCard reader does not work, I decided not to contact Asus remembering my previous pain. Now 4 weeks since I used this phone, it stopped connecting to Wi-Fi and I had to perform factory reset to correct issue. Thus decided to change from 2 stars to 1 star.Additional details: 5/13/206: So all of a sudden this mobile lost its sound, no ring, no audio, no music nothing but only through headphone.

Unrooted version. The phone is clean.Pros:fast processor, decent screen, decent soundConsBattery life sucks. Overheats to ridiculous levels. Not fully compatible with Sony Bluetooth headphones.I will focus on what is wrong since those features are what matter to me the most.Battery life is BAD. Using the standard Sony Launcher, with 1-2 hours of calls each day, 50-100 texts, one or two youtube videos of 5 mins each, the battery barely lasts 7-8 hours. I don't play games other than occasional crossword. General activities are check email, update todo, and do calendars. My workday goes from 6 AM to 10 PM. So at 3/4 of my day, the phone is dead. It takes 4 hours for a full recharge. I have to charge in 10 minute bursts to keep up for the rest of the day.Heating is a HUGE problem. If the calls go longer than 10-15 minutes, the phone can barely be handled. Yes, it has the latest firmware in it. I cannot place the phone against my ear or even hold it by the corners because of the heating. That brings us to the next problem. I tried using headsets.The bluetooth pairing with Bose earpiece is bad on a good day. It drops the bluetooth connections randomly. The earpiece is in perfect shape since it works correctly with every other phone in the house (iphone, galaxy, moto X and moto G). So I purchased a Sony set.

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,971.6,5,"BLU 6.0 LTE unlocked phone:Reason for purchase: We had Straight Talk phones running on “Network S” (Sprint). Service was strong in urban areas, but on vacation in Northern Wisconsin, “Network S” had zero service. Solution: buy an unlocked phone and get a 99-cent “Network A” (ATT) SIM card from Straight Talk. Presto! Straight Talk service everywhere on the ATT network! We chose this model because of the screen size, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of internal memory, SD-card slot, removable battery, and generally good reviews on Amazon.Unboxing: Everything was present and undamaged. The included silicone case was a nice bonus. The phone arrived 2/3 charged, and connected to our WIFI immediately when turned on.SIM installation: The micro-SIM card fit just fine. Porting the old number from the previous phone was a simple process on the Straight Talk website (had to wait about an hour for the switch to occur).Software update: The phone offered a software update, which took less than 3 minutes. The notes said the changes include faster/smoother operation and more ear volume.Freedom from bloatware: This phone comes with plain-vanilla Android and leaves it to the user to download whatever he or she wants from the Google Play store. As a consequence, there are several extra gigabytes of free space on the internal memory than on carrier-bought phones. Sweet!Camera: The camera operated as expected and photos looked sharp in normal light. This camera does not make dimly-lit night scenes look like daylight, but there was no unusual noise. Focus time and shutter lag seem typical of smartphones, maybe a little better than average. Video looked smooth and sharp at both 720p and 1080p. The camera and movie user controls are basic. If extra-fancy controls are desired, the free “Camera FV-5” and “Cinema FV-5” software available on Google Play work nicely with this phone.SD Expansion Card: With a 32-GB card installed, the phone recognized it instantly. When trying a 64-GB card using the exFAT file system, the phone did not recognize it. Unfortunately, the latest versions of Windows won’t format anything to FAT32. We found a free, tiny PC program on the web from an outfit called “Ridgecrop Consultants” to re-format the card to the FAT32 file system. The process required a PC USB-adaptor for the SD-card, and about two minutes of effort including scanning that tiny little program for viruses with our anti-virus software. With the card re-formatted to FAT32, the phone instantly recognized the full capacity of the card and all was well. If re-formatting an SD-card scares you, just use a standard 32-GB card.Smoothness: Scrolling and operation of the phone for its own menus and files is smooth and nearly instantaneous. Smooth scrolling of websites is dependent on the cellular signal and whether a page is bogged down with tons of advertising and Javascript. Websites load and scroll as quickly and smoothly as with any other smartphone we've seen. We tested the phone with its internal browser, and also with Chrome and Firefox. All browsers functioned as expected.Sound quality: There is plenty of volume from the handset, speakerphone, and earpieces. Other reviewers complained about volume; perhaps it was the latest firmware update that took care of that because we have no complaints.FM radio: What a nice feature! The cord for the earpieces doubles as the FM antenna. We picked up dozens of stations, and discovered that some stations broadcast text-info song information which is displayed on the screen along with a note that it is “HD Radio.” What a pleasant surprise! Cell phone carriers do not like FM because it is free and requires no data… but it’s great for the consumer. The phone also includes a native app to record songs off the FM radio! That’s handy! Most smartphones are designed with FM radios in them but the carriers disable them to force consumers to use data to hear music. U.S. broadcasters are lobbying for legislation to prohibit the cell-carriers from disabling and hiding the FM radios on smartphones. That's a consumer-friendly idea. By the way, this phone's FM tuning can be set to work anywhere in the world (channel spacing differs slightly in different parts of the world).Screen: The 6-inch screen is practically a tablet. Typing is easy and video looks great. The pixels are smaller than the naked eye can see. Big screens are a good idea. The brightness and color look similar to Galaxy phones and there is a “vivid” setting for people who like that. One has to shade the screen to see it in full direct sunlight, but this is not unusual compared to other phones.Cellular performance: We are getting clear voice, fast data, and the “4G” indicator is coming on in urban areas. Performance is plenty fast… we don’t really need to use up our entire month’s data in one minute, anyway.Battery: This battery is a lot bigger than the one in our old Samsung phone, but the screen is a lot bigger, too. With light usage, the battery will last all day. With heavy usage, a recharge will be needed. Standard micro-USB chargers work fine with this phone. The battery is removable and replaceable, a feature that we like.Ant-virus: The AVG anti-virus software available from the Google Play store downloaded without a hitch and works fine on this phone. The program flagged that ""USB debugging"" was currently enabled on the phone, so we toggled that on-off control to ""off.""Summary: Having read all the other reviews, we were ready to “do battle” with any problem imaginable. Happily, this phone arrived on time, in perfect condition, and has exceeded our expectations. We accomplished our objective of getting on the ATT network using Straight Talk. One of our colleagues bought this same model and loves it. We plan to replace our other old phone with this same model.UPDATE: We found the solution for the ""weak microphone"" problem that some people are having. Like many new phones, this phone uses aggressive noise cancellation. Any sounds that can be heard equally by both the upper and lower microphones are cancelled out. So do one of the following: 1) Make sure to always speak with your lips near the bottom edge of the phone, or if you can't do that, 2) put a little piece of electrical tape over the top-edge pinhole for the upper microphone (this is the cancellation mic). Presto -- loud, clear voice transmission!",2.0,4

"BLU Dash 4.0 D270a Unlocked Dual SIM Phone with Dual-Core 1GHz Processor, Android 4.0 ICS, 3G HSPA, and High Res LCD Screen - U.S. Warranty (Black)",CT-Miami LLC,74.5,5,"The phone runs smooth, the dual-core 1ghz a5 cpu is very capable, it scored only 10% slower than my dual-core 1.5ghz a9 cpu Pantech Burst. The screen, although not AMOLED, it is actually brighter than the AMOLED screen on Pantech Burst. Dual sim is a huge advantage over single sim, you can finally separate business phone vs personal phone calls without having to either carry two phones, or swapping sim cards. This version supports 850/1900mhz 3g so its compatible with most US carriers. An international version with 850/2100mhz model number D270i can also be purchased on Amazon for similiar price.The battery is 1500 mAh, they LAST FOREVER! perhaps its the super effecient A5 cpu used in the phone, general usage (5 phone calls, 20-30 text messages, 1-2 hr gaming per day), the phone lasted 2 days between charges. This is excellent running time for a $120 device with a beautiful screen.Verdict:Excellent value from performance to price to feature ratio. The screen is excellent and very very bright, speed is good and feature is complete. The dual-core cpu offers enough speed for most people, which dual sim capable helps people with need to utilize 2 phones at a time. The only down side about the phone, is perhaps its 512mb ram that might hinder future upgrades. However, I have not personally noticed any lagging or performance issues.",0.0,4

This one, the J7, is a keeper. I can't see anything negative about it so far.Appearance: looks great, perfect 5.5"" basic HD display. Because it's plastic rather than metal, it's not heavy. It's very slim so can fit nicely in your pocket or small handbag.Performance: finally a phone that pairs and keeps Bluetooth connection, rather than drops it after 10 minutes (which plagues many Android 5.1 devices). Reception seems fine, not better or worse than other phones, my signal showing around -73, the same as other phones. Call quality was perfect, clear, loud on speakerphone, and the other party had no difficulty hearing me either. It has been documented that plastic phones are better than metal when it comes to signal. As I look for a phone that works well as a ""phone"" rather than everything but, signal and call quality are super important to me.Camera: can't go wrong with 13 mp back camera. Clear, sharp photos that you can edit with the help of many photo apps out there. And because of the nice, crisp screen, your photos look good.Battery: 3000 mAh seem to last forever. It comsumes Zero power at night on standby. Charged it to 100% before going to bed and in the morning it's still 100%.I like the fact that is has a micro sim (2 slots) rather than the invisible nano, which I will probably lose within 2 seconds of handling it never to be found. Huge expansion storage on micro sd card, which cleverly slides on top of sim 1 to save space.My phone was purchased ""used, like new"" from JP Mobiles, arrived very fast, as new looking as can be.

"Nokia E71x Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 3.2 MP Camera and Dual-Band 3G (Black)",Nokia,59.99,4,"I bought this phone for my husband in January and another one for myself in March. That shows how much I like this phone. Beyond everyone's ravings, here are some points from my personal experience with the phone:1. battery life is not as long as claimed in the product info. My husband's phone lasts about 2.5 to 3 days with one full charge. He uses it for voice calls only with about 30 minutes daily talk time. I typically get more functions of my phone with usually 10-20 short phone calls, a dozen text messages, 10-30 minutes podcast and checking emails with wifi 3 to 5 times a day. My phone's battery indicator gets down to the last 2 bars by the end of day. So I have been charging it daily.2. Good language support but less ideal than iPhone. I bought the North American version so the phone comes with English, French and Spanish. I was able to install Asian fonts on both my phones without much hassle. My iPhone came with the option to change languages out of box.Notwithstanding the above, I truly appreciate the beauty and functionality of the phone - otherwise I wouldn't have bought two!Update 6/13/09: we have been living in China and Europe for the past several months and use the E71s with local service providers (the beauty of an unlocked phone!). The phone performance seems to deteriorate: the phone would turn off by itself - sometimes in the middle of a call about at least once a week. Occasionally, I can hear the other side fine but the other side can't hear me. Not sure whether this is a network compatibility issue. I have been trolling websites to find cures - some suggest doing a complete software upgrade. I am seriously considering it even though I may have to spend more time to configure it the way I like.",3.0,2

The Android part is wonderful with the new Marshmallow 6.01 operating system features. All of my APPS downloaded and installed properly from Google and Amazon app stores and work just as good as on my expensive Tablet. My new ZMAX2 handles even large and Graphically intensive apps with no glitches or problems. I love the large (5 1/2"" viewable) screen with awesome, vibrant display. Also reasonably light weight for it's size and fits fine in my pockets.I do not usually impress easily with new technology devices but this one is a sure winner in my book.

Now which is a better phone? Obviously the flagship Samsung or similar but do you really need your Instagram to load .3 seconds faster or use your phone as a remote? I aint being fooled brah!So in all, this is a great low-end-high-end phone.

This makes the keyboard about the same size as the portrait keyboard of my galaxy s53 - yes the battery is tiny after it hits 15% it drops super fast. The phone is smaller than a credit card. I do get a full day out it, I use it for phone calls , a little music and texting I do not watch videos or browse the web with this as it is micro sized!4 - yes this has full android with the play store.

Cost me $45 to try it out. There is a youtube video about this phone by a reviewer who also purchased from Amazon. It got so hot below the camera area he returned it before reviewing it. After I had the same problem I looked for info l & found his ""review"" then. Purchased 8-12-16 from lifeline786 and they did offer a refund. It didn't seem as sturdy as described. But I took it to my carrier and they are offering the same phone in white with a rebate, and employee felt it was the same phone, so, I didn't return it at that time. I've since had a problem with spot under the camera area being warm, and used it only as a tablet for a couple of weeks before switching it to my carrier. I'm having problems (1st time out of 4 phones, all were Nokias, on this carrier) losing service sometimes after disconnecting from the car's built in blue tooth. I'm in 'park and go' volunteer teaching work, so that is a problem. I'm finding apps are not as stable as I'd hoped, having switched from Windows 10 to Android for that reason. The other reason was the AMOLED screen available on this phone, which is truly a +! There is no support available anywhere for this phone, which is often the case with unlocked devices. 1st day in full use as a phone with 47% of battery left & not in use for last hour, only bluetooth connected, had a very hot phone in my purse. I shut the phone off & knowing it isn't great for ion batteries to fall below 1/2, started charging. I'd already deactivated as many things/apps as possible on the phone before switching phones with my carrier, but I don't feel it is performing well. It hasn't gotten nearly that hot since, but that was this week. Never had a Nokia do this, but neither has my Samsung Galaxy Tablet which has been through a lot, & after 3 years still holds a charge nicely. We have to remember that nearly all our devices are originating in China, and standards are different, perhaps declining.",1.0,0

Samsung Galaxy J5 J500M 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 13MP Camera - White (International Version),Samsung,182.49,5,"This is my first smartphone, I always had flip phones pre-paid, first virgin mobile (14 years) and now Tracfone (2 years) since I didn't have the need of internet on the phone and I still don't. As some people already said, the phone is made of plastic, which it doesn't bother me since the majority of previous cell phone were made of some sort of plastic and no one was complaining about it back then. I bought this phone 3 reasons, 1) The price. I spend about a month or more doing research, reading reviews and watching youtube videos about the phones. After all that, I have decided to get this one since I already have a samsung tables, computer monitor & tv so I knew I couldn't go wrong. 2) Even though this is an 8GB, 1.5GB RAM + microSD Slot Expandable up to 128GB, is pretty fast, excellent response and bright and good size. So far I like it a lot. And 3) The most important reason I got it is, since I have Tracfone pre-paid phone service I was able to transfer my tracfone number and balance to this phone with no problems at all. The best thing of all is I have a smartphone that it can do anything just like the iphone and all those expensive ones, go to the internet when I need to without the phone bill and saving hundreds a year. The minutes and data roll over every month when I don't use them. Can you say the same for you phone service?

"BLU Life Pure Unlocked Phone 32GB ROM, 2GB RAM (White)",BLU,150.0,2,"Even considering the low price I simply can not recommend this phone. GPS started failing after 6 months of heavy use (used daily as my GPS device). Apparently tech support does not exist. The Android GUI has been butchered, no app button, blurred wallpaper, lots of modifications that don't help at all making the phone run slow despite pretty decent specs (I really hated the PIN entry delay or the phone not even registering my touch). I was forced to root my device and remove a lot of BLU added modifications, installed NOVA launcher and was able to finally have a decent GUI with clear wallpaper that scrolls (for some odd reason this is not available with stock setup). This of course voids the warranty. It is running Android 4.2.1 that is affected by Stagefright vulnerability and you should expect no updates. Ever. No third party ROMs are available and there seems to be very little interest among developer community to do any work with this phone. This will be my first and last BLU phone (this seems to be fairly common among BLU users).For those of you still willing to try to make this phone usable this is what I did to gain root access and modify settingsGained root with framaroot (google it, very simple)Check for app updates in Google Play and install themInstalled NOVA launcher (you can use other launchers just make sure you install one BEFORE you do the next steps)Install Build Prop Tweaker Lite (free) and modify the followingro.gn.navil.lock.scrn=yes change it to noro.gn.navi.launcher.support=yes change it to noRebootPS Keep in mind this will void your warranty but considering you should expect no support from BLU it makes no difference.

The packaging was adequate and strong enough to protect it from any damage from the perils of shipping.This is an excellent product. The reason i took two stars away because of how apple has spent so much time and energy fighting jailbreaking. if they would only provide half the seriously useful tweaks that the Cydia store does, I would not jailbreak. As of now im lucky to be on iOS 5.1.1 since I can jailbreak and use the tweaks Ive bought. i will not upgrade to the iPhone 5 since it cannot be jailbroken and iOS is lacking many features that ive come to rely on that Cydia provides.I have used the iPhone since its second iteration (3G) and have upgraded religiously every time Apple has released a new one. But, I am seriously considering switching to an Android phone for my next smartphone if jailbreaking continues to get more difficult.Update 2016-07-10: I did move on to Android after my experiences with the 4S. I am happy with the move and have not bought another Apple product since. Android is flexible and a more open platform.DISCLAIMER:=All opinions I have expressed, are my own, and derived from actual use of and experience with the product.=I only leave positive feedback and reviews when the product meets my expectations.=When I am making my decision to buy a product online, I rely heavily on other’s reviews and feedback.

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,5,"The Samsung Exhibit II 4G is a great phone. The Amazon price for this phone was 100.00 cheaper than the T-mobile price. I researched this phone and this phone has met my expectations and more. I previously had a Blackberry 9700.The TeleNav GPS app that had a monthly fee is a free app on this phone. Also, includes the Google navigation and maps. So 2 Navigation apps for free.The Voice Search works as well as the Iphone voice search app. The phone is easy to use and set-up. If you dont turn off the apps running in the background the battery will die in 5hrs. So, turn off the background apps, backout of the apps no longer in use. My battery last at least 12 hrs-14hrs.The only negative is , the screen washes out in the bright sun. For the money, and 30-50 dollars a month( depending on the plan us choose) you can't get a better phone. It is a great phone. i just set up Kies air which I can view on my PC everything on my phone, pictures, messages, videos etc. Supports Adobe Flash player which my Blackberry 9700 did not. I could on.

Apple iPhone 5s 64GB (Gold) -T-Mobile,Apple,265.0,5,"This phone was a major transition from android based phones. After 2 weeks of really getting accustomed to this Apple iPhone it really changed the perspective I have of apple. First, it is pricey but worth the investment because of its smoothness, quality, and warm feeling of ownership it gives you. Second, battery life was an substantial improvement over many android phones I have owned that do not have a problem draining on your time. Siri is awesome and a person that does not use vocal command devices will have a great time with issuing out commands and asking questions.My only cons are I wish that many android based apps were transferrable but no complaints because the way technology is common to adaptation and delivering the very best to its consumers it'll only be a matter of time.The screen display is excellent but unfortunately this phone isn't as big either compared to other ultra smartphones but definitely makes up with its sleek traditionalistic screen and clarity.

I'm very doubtful of Android phone security but Androids have great flexibility. Windows Phones are the phone to get if you want a phone that has more security than an Android but are not interested in games.

HTC One M8 - Factory Unlocked 32GB - US Warranty (Glacial Silver),HTC,138.99,5,"My 3 previous cellphones were: Nexus 4, Nexus 4 (fist one had screen broken after a fall), Moto X Dev Edtion, Sony Xpezia Z1. What I can tell you is once you have a Moto X you get spoiled by all the Active Display and Wakeup features, that's why I mainly replace my Z1 by the HTC One M8. Device is beautiful, finish gorgeous. As for the UI, best closest to the Pure Android Experience.I'm not a big fan of Cam, so I really don't care about the downgrade from a 20.3 mp to a 4mp. The picture quality are good enough, bright, alive to share with others in smartphones or computers. Zoe is excellent, Boomsound is amazing comparing to the crappy sound/speakers from the Z1.If you're looking for a camera, by a Z1 or Z2. if you're looking for a nice smartphone, with nice UI and features, 6months screen replace for free, then get this HTC One. In my personal opening, the form facto is far superior to the Z1. Only Moto X, can compete because of the curve back.",2.0,4

OtterBox Defender Series Case for Apple iPhone 6 Plus - Ink Blot,,24.99,4,"Bought to protect my iPhone 6S Plus. Been using it since the phone released. I had a defender series on my previous phone iPhone 5.Pros: Same solid protection. I have drop my phone a few times and not a problem. Rubber outer layer helps to keep the phone from sliding and helps my grip.Cons: Find that if I have my phone on speaker phone and the mic isn't pointed towards me that people sometimes have trouble hearing me. The whole around the mic is a little small and that is probably what causes that. The built in screen protector has a noticeable gap between the screen. This doesn't look bad but makes you have to use a little more force to type which can be weird with the new 3D Touch on the 6S. Once I got use to that it was not a big deal. Plastic piece over the home key looks a little weird. Not a deal breaker though.Overall it is a good case. The space with the screen protector takes some getting use to but it works fine. This case does what I bought it for, too protect may phone.",0.0,3

The sad thing about it is that I purchased it with the sole intention of transferring my pictures and videos from the old samsung strive to the new one. AT&T assisted me with this undertaking.What happened was that because the phone had a defect, years and years worth of pictures and videos were lost. I have not been able to retrieve them at all. I am so broken hearted over this because they were pictures and videos I had intended to put on a DVD for the sake of preserving history. Now they are gone and my phone is gone. But I love the Samsung Strive more than anyother phone I have ever used. Would love to have another one. Amazon should replace my phone free of charge, for sending me a defective phone and for it losing my precious photo and video treasures. They are irreplaceable...In addition, the phone you sent was supposed to be new, at least that is what I was told over the phone but when I received it, it clearly stated on the box that it had been refurbishedApparently, the quality control inspector missed this one!!!! Does Amazon HAVE a Quality Control Inspector? All I know is that this was my very first order with Amazon but now am reluctant to order anything else and I really need that SAMSUNG STRIVEOne that is not defective. The Samsung Strive is the phone I know and am the most comfortable with. I have a disability and this phone works best for me. I have tried other phones but nothing compares to the Samsung Strive. Please send me another one. But please have someone check it out before you send it to make sure IT isn't defective too. Do the ""RIGHT"" thing and foot the bill it is only fair. I'm lost without that phone...There are other products I want to order but again, am hesitant. You do right by me on this and I may reconsider.Thank you,Sheryl A.

Apple - Iphone 5c A1532 Verizon 16 GB Cell Phone - White,Apple,139.95,5,"I purchased this phone after not reading thoroughly, from another vendor and ended up with an unlocked iPhone incompatible with my carrier/ provider. Although disappointing, it was totally my fault. Luckily, I was able to return that phone and purchase this one. It is very important to educate yourself and read all of the product description before purchasing something like this. Although The previous vendor I worked with was fantastic with the return and refund process, I could've save myself the hassle if I just paid attention. Moving on, this phone is fantastic. It is completely functional, and works better than a previous iPhone I had purchased brand-new. If you are buying this iPhone and have not previously owned an iPhone, you will need to purchase a Sim card to activate this phone. You can get them for a small charge at your local Carrier/Provider/Apple store, or you can just order one here and save yourself the hassle. Again make sure the Sim card is appropriate to your carrier/ provider.I see some top rated reviews here indicating not to trust the seller. I have to say that the seller was absolutely phenomenal, everything arrived in tiptop condition and in all original packaging, with Apple certified charger and earbuds. I really couldn't be happier with the purchase. Just remember, be specific about your carrier. Also remember, unlocked does not mean compatible with server. Any refurbished iPhone you purchase will be unlocked, but if you have a Verizon carrier get a Verizon compatible phone, same with AT&T, Sprint, or whatever the case may be. The same goes with the Sim card, make sure it is compatible with your carrier. I cannot emphasize this enough.",2.0,0

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 64GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,299.0,4,"I went back and forth in my decision to buy this slightly more expensive version, or go with the regular Moto G. This won out, since the spec's were better (more RAM, memory, better mp camera, fingerprint sensor). I chose the $50 gift card bundle, and after checkout the phone itself totaled $249 (+ tax which was about $13). The gift card arrived the next day, allowing me to buy accessories for my phone!First of all, I've been a long time Tracfone user, and have only used TF certified phones in the past.Since TF now has a BYOP (Bring Your Own Phone) plan, it made more sense to buy an unlocked phone with up-to-date technology (and no restriction on updating Android).Setup was relatively easy. I purchased the BYOP SIM kit from Walmart, and used the CDMA 4G network card (the mini sim). I decided not to port my old TF phone number, so setup (via my account on Tracfone) was lightning fast. Within a couple of minutes, my phone number, and minutes were ported to my phone. (I'm happy to say that the regular Tracfone minutes cards WILL triple. However, I don't believe the ""Smartphone"" designated cards will.) My phone screen shows that I'm on the Verizon 4G network. In order to access my minutes/text/data balance, I had to d/l the Tracfone app. for that (through Google Play).For whatever reason I was unable to get a proper wireless signal from my current router (I've never used the wireless, only the wired Ethernet portion, so I'm not exactly sure sure if it's just a problem with my router configuration or what. I may have to contact my provider about it.)As a work around I purchased the ""Plugable USB OTG Micro-B Ethernet Adaptor"" (via Amazon). It came today, and it immediately worked upon connection.The only odd thing was after downloading 2 Google Play App's, the app's themselves needed further downloading upon opening (basically they're shell programs, with customizable options upon startup), and it didn't recognize that I had internet due to my data and wireless being turned off, so I guess I will have to finish upgrading the app. when I get to a wireless signal, or buy more data minutes).The camera is a huge plus for me, as my regular Canon digital has the same mp as this internal camera (16). I've already taken a bunch of pictures with it, and I can say that it's slightly better than my Canon in some respects.We had a storm yesterday, and I was able to capture a lightning strike! The video also looks good. My favorite thing so far is the ""Panorama"", something my Canon doesn't have.As my previous phone camera's haven't had half as good of resolution, or the additional features, I can definitely say this is the best cellphone camera I've ever had!I'm hard of hearing in both ears, but the volume sounds very adequate for the ringtones, the radio, and a downloaded video. I haven't actually made a call yet, so I can't comment on that yet.The screen resolution is beautiful, and crisp! I have d/l'd additional wallpapers because the provided ones were few.In order to connect the phone as a recognizable media device to your computer, you MUST go to the top, and pull down the tab, and change it from ""charging"" to what you want to use it for. Otherwise just plugging it in via usb to your computer will NOT automatically show your files. It took me a while to figure this out, but I found the answer on an online forum, and thought I'd pass on this important info!After doing this I was able to transfer the ""wallpaper"", and additional ringtones to my phone.FYI, for ringtones, you must add the mp3 file directly to your ringtones folder, otherwise there's no option on the file itself to make it a ringtone.For now, this is all I can think of. So far I'm very pleased with this phone! And recommend it to Tracfone users looking for a compatible unlocked phone!_______As of Aug 8, 2016 I decided to drop my phone down a star because I just learned I have 3 security vulnerabilities on my phone.After reading this article: bbc.com/news/technology-37005226 And downloading the app ""QuadRooter"" on GooglePlay checkpoint.com/resources/quadrooter-vulnerability-consumer/ (despite my phone not being one of those listed), it showed that I had the following vulnerablities:CVE-2016-2504CVE-2016-2503CVE-2016-5340For security purposes I had already d/l'd an Antivirus, and Firewall.The fact that the vulnerabilities were discovered between ""Feb. and April"", long before the phone was launched in July, makes me wonder why Motorola/Lenovo went ahead and use a defective chip? At the very least install the patches for these vulnerabilities?The article states: ""In response, Qualcomm is believed to have created patches for the bugs and started to use the fixed versions in its factories. It has also distributed the patches to phone makers and operators. However, it is not clear how many of those companies have issued updates to customers' phones.""I have since checked the forums, and while it appears they are aware of the problem, no patches have been released by them! How long is it going to take for them to release the patch that they've already supposedly been given by Qualcomm?!If you want to browse the forums go here: forums.lenovo.com/t5/Moto-G4-Moto-G4-Plus/bd-p/MotoG4thGen",5.0,4

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,971.6,4,"Terrific phone at a great price. The screen is beautiful, and big, and all my friends who've looked at the phone have been impressed with it. This is my first cell phone of any kind, and I have had a big learning curve. (Also bought Android for Dummies, a Kenu plus sized car holder for it, car charger and cable, SD storage card, and a belt loop case holder.)Reading through all the previous reviews of this phone has been really helpful for figuring out many things in advance. For instance, if you want to use a 64GB SD storage card, or larger, you need to reformat it to FAT32. An online You Tube tutorial guided me through that handily, including downloading a program that did the hard work for me. Various apps also recommended in previous reviews were helpful. (For the ""reboot problem"" some reviewers complained of, a previous review says to check the silicon backing case that comes with phone. I have not had any such problems, so maybe they fixed the case?)So far I am impressed. Great big high resolution screen really mattered to me. Everything so far seems to work beautifully.. Speed and responsiveness seem excellent. Very nice that BLU includes the protective screen already on phone and a silicone back case protector and earbuds. The only reason I've lowered one star: sound management. There's what seems to be a not infrequent ANDROID problem (i.e., not only Blu phones): when I listen to the FM radio through the ear buds, it's just too loud, even on the lowest volume setting. Nice that it HAS an FM radio, not all phones do--I'm trying to solve the volume problem with apps, but that's cumbersome. Other sound tasks (Pandora, Amazon music) are not too loud with the earbuds, only the radio. I haven't yet used the actual phone call function with earbuds. But in any case the sound levels are something I'd like more control over than I've been finding I have. Maybe some of that's ignorance--I'd like to make the notifications quieter while keeping ring tone loud (except NOT with earbuds in--I have no idea if I'd be deafened if I got a call while listening on earbuds). I'd like to see settable sound profiles with and without the earbuds and more gradations between one sound level and the next on the phone's own volume control..Still learning the camera also. This phone may not be the best to use for camera purposes, because the size makes it hard to hold onto in less than ideal circumstances. But I wanted the big screen for other reasons, so that's a trade off I chose, even though I didn't realize at the time I was choosing it. The quality of the few photos I've taken thus far is really good--outside, in daylight. Low light without flash, not so great. I plan to get a camera app recommended by another reviewer to see if I like it better than the one that comes with the phone.Summing up: I'm very happy to get a big and very high quality smartphone unlocked at this price. I'm starting out with the least expensive T-Moblie $30/month plan and like knowing that I can change to another plan or different GSM cell phone service provider any time I want. I wanted to be able to buy a local SIM in Europe and the second SIM card was a big plus for me with this phone. The phone does sound as if it's especially well tuned for use on T-Mobile--I picked my carrier because of reading that here. But meanwhile, unlocked seems to me the only fair thing--price a phone reasonably and then let the user go where he/she wants with it. Thanks, BLU.My one silly regret so far: I got black. I think the white would have been more elegant.",4.0,4

As long as you know the limitations that the size brings and can deal with them you may love this as much as I did, though ultimately I decided to give it up and switch to one of the giant phones that look so goofy in a holster case.I love this phone but because my fingers are normal male size input was very difficult. I bought a fine point stylus but I wasn't adept enough to input accrately. If your fingers are thin and your use of a stylus is better it might work well for you. As an alternative the voice input worked well, though that meant I was subject to the random capitalization and off the wall interpretation of Google voice.The screen is fragile. One short drop wiped out a number of pixels. Unfortunately there aren't any protective cases for it. I loved having a phone I could fit in my jean's coin pocket. Because I volunteer at a thrift store I was able to find a belt holster that was small enough to use when I wasn't wearing jeans.I'm guessing that the small size meant that the battery was smaller. It made it though the day but I wasn't using cell data and only rarely used bluetooth or wi-fi. The micro sd card worked well.I used this on Consumer Cellular.",3.0,4

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,578.0,2,"Disclaimer: this review is mostly about the widespread bootloop issue, and some comments about the quality of the phone in general.I - Marshmallow had performance issues. Nougat made it great.I bought this phone in December 2015. On the first weeks, this phone was plagued by weird performance issues: slowdowns, quick freezes and just mediocre performance that constantly required rebooting in order to regain the smoothness it should have: being a Nexus 5 (not 5X) owner myself, I knew this one couldn't possibly be so inferior to its predecessor. Recently, the Nougat update finally turned it into the perfect phone for me, and so I was satisfied.II - Soon after, LG Bootloops appeared, rendering phone unusable.This week, I was yet another person hit by the infamous LG bootloop defect. If you don't know already, I sincerely recommend you inform yourself about it before buying this phone. Many LG models—and most of the expensive ones, 5X, G3, G4 etc. included—are plagued by some sort of these defects.As far as I know (I'm not into the technical details), there is a hardware defect on this model regarding the flash memory chip, a problem at the project level. For what I've heard, LG is issuing full refunds for those who are eligible for warranty in US. For those outside United States, or that bought the phone while in US, you are probably better giving it to a recycling center or selling it for parts, I'd guess.III - What to do?Nothing. In my particular case, and many other for what I've seen on XDA and other sites, there is no way to recover as this appears to be due to low quality of the hardware. Even trying to flash images through specialized software (with TOT images) is not possible, as the firmware download software on the phone will freeze, just like the regular boot system.IV - Alternatives and comments about other aspects of the phone.Still, that loses your time, gives you a headache and a surprise you didn't prepare yourself for, forces you to buy a new phone (if you live outside US, like I do, sorry), perhaps a larger 6P or a very expensive Pixel.Shame, because besides being a Nexus and having plenty of potential, it also has a wonderful camera that can truly take excellent pictures, especially if you know what you're doing. I'm including some samples on this review, just remember that this is a small sample that does not make justice to the full, pixel by pixel originals. Panoramas and photo spheres also come much better than the ones in my old Nexus 5 ever did. Other than that, I don't need to tell you because if you're looking for a Nexus 5X you already know what to expect and you made your homework by now.That said, this the summary of my review:- Running Marshmallow: 3 or 4 stars out of five, because of sudden performance issues.- Running Nougat: 5 stars. No complains.- Widespread bootloops and possible project defect less than a year after *release*: 2 stars because it was very good with Nougat.V - Avoiding LG phones.On a sidenote, my Nexus 5 also failed due to a hardware defect: the power button issue, which also gives you bootloops, rendering your phone unusable after quite a few months depending on the usage profile. Because of that, 2 disappointments out of 2, and considering the widespread issues with other LG models, I'm quite sure it will be a long, long time before I buy any LG phone ever again. I have many old phones (an old GNex running Marshmallow, to name one…) that I use for testing and I don't remember suffering from things like this in any of them.",0.0,4

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - Orange,BLU,149.83,3,"This is my 5th Blu phone, and if you can get these phones when they are on sale, then they are a great value for your money.First things first1) This phone does not run lollipop, and you cannot update to lollipop as well (as of now).2) It comes with 4.4.2, and Blu put a lollipop wallpaper, pretending its running lollipop.3) I assume the lollipop update is coming sometime in future, but why put upgradable to lollipop everywhere and make false advertising...Other than the gripes above, this phone is worth $80, runs pretty much stock android and you have all the features you want (dual sim, FM radio, tethering, 5.5 inch 720p screen etc). Phone comes with a soft plastic case, pre-installed screen protector and an additional screen protector as well.I have T-Mobile, and get a decent reception. Internet Tethering works great and battery lasts almost 2 days. I did not like the default launcher, as the icons are too big and wont let me slide to left. I replaced it with Nova launcher, and icons and screens are crisp now. I put a 64GB Samsung Evo SD card, and the phone detected it on reboot.Great phone when on sale.",9.0,4

It worked great and she loved it until a little over a year later the phone's microphone stopped working. She could still use it on speakerphone and with the headphone/microphone that came with it but that was not always convenient. When it did work, it was great. It was really fast and did everything that you would expect a smart phone to do and it did it very well. For the price, it was a bargain . Until the microphone stopped working. The warranty had just run out right after Christmas 2015, so I bought her the Asus ZenFone 2 Laser phone which she absolutely loves. It was only thirty dollars more than the POSH Titan was but had more storage, more speed and it was a little bigger. One thing I should mention about the POSH is the camera was very good.",1.0,4

"Motorola Moto X - 16GB, Unlocked Phone - US Warranty - Black",Motorola,89.99,4,"Some difficulties using it overseas on foreign networks but overall it has been a great phone. Due to language barriers, the errors the phone gives me can't seem to be fixed by the mobile phone companies in town. The camera works OK, it was my main reason for purchasing the phone with data & cell service. I think my old HTC takes better pictures with a lower pixel count. It's difficult to adjust the camera settings and it seems to want to ignore screen saving settings. Sometimes it will dim in 15 seconds and other times it will stay on all night. I have done searches and can't seem to find a way to fix this setting or where the conflicting times/programming is located to have it dim & lock quickly to save battery life. It needs to be darkened or it will only last 1/2 day on a full charge. It was much less expensive than other unlocked phones. I find the quirks almost par for the course - I am overseas, with a phone I purchased in the States, on a network and country that has very limited English - I could have waited until I arrived in-country and purchased an unlocked Samsung or Iphone. However, I didn't know what the pricing and options would be prior to my arrival. It's served to be what I needed and seems to be reliable and predictable.",1.0,2
