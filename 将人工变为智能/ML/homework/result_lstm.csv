Apple iPhone 4 A1332 32GB Black (GSM Unlocked),Apple,75.0,3,The deal sounds amazing but the home button is really hard to press to work. The heat plate and screws aren't on the inside so you will have poor wifi connection.,0.0,0

"Nokia E71x Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 3.2 MP Camera and Dual-Band 3G (Black)",Nokia,59.99,5,"I was using Blackberries before but have to admit that the Nokiafeels technologically more refined than the BBs. With the SymbianOS I really have choices for e-mail Push clients and are notdependent on BB and their services. This was an important reason to buyNokia. For $220.-, a metal casing this phone is a steal.I am using it with T-Mobile in the US and e-plus in Germany, switchingSIMs. 3G does not work with T-Mobiledue to frequency mismatch. Keyboard is smaller than that of a BBbut works as well after getting used to it. The included GPS andcamera works great.",2.0,4

LG Optimus G Pro E980 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone - Black,LG,729.0,1,Sender told me I could receive 4 g with t mobile sim card. Phone would not accept Tmobile sim initially until I bought unlock code. Advertisement stated unlocked and rooted but it was not. T mobile does not have frequency band required to operate in 4g or LTE. I contacted sender prior to return period expiring and sender told me I could not return.

"Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge SM-G935F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - International Version, No Warranty (Titanium Silver)",,593.5,5,"My husband and I bought these as an upgrade from our previous Galaxy S5s. I got the rose gold and he got the black one. The rose gold color wasn't as rosy as I thought it would be, it's more of a champagne color. The black one looks very sophisticated and elegant. I must say that I was not a fan of Samsung borrowing Apple's idea of no memory storage and making it difficult to put the sim card in but it was an easy fix with being able to send all of my extra photos to my Samsung account. Upon arrival, the packaging makes sure the product is not harmed whatsoever (lots and lots of bubble wrap). In all honesty I was afraid the phone was not going to hold up very long because of the glass edge and because I'm prone to dropping my phone...a lot. However even with out a case it has held up quite well. The photo quality of the front and rear camera is amazing, definitely a step (or two) up from the S5. We decided to buy on amazon because the price listed was $200-$300 cheaper than buying in stores, plus free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime. All in all I would highly reccommend this phone if you're a Samsung lover like myself.",0.0,4

"OtterBox SYMMETRY SERIES Case for iPhone 6 Plus/6s Plus (5.5"" Version) - Retail Packaging - BLUE PRINT II (SLATE GREY/DEEP WATER BLUE)",OtterBox,15.99,5,This is a wonderful case! I have already dropped it and my phone was fine. The colors are beautiful and are almost exactly what you see in the photos. I got a new Iwatch and it matches it perfectly I am so happy. I love otter boxes and I am a very loyal customer. There is no telling how many phones and hundreds of dollars they have saved me. The only con about this case is unlike other cases there is no cover for your headphones or charging port so if you drop water on this you are gonna be in deep trouble! Just stay clear of water and you can chunk your phone across the room as much as you'd like.,0.0,4

BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Smartphone - Unlocked - Orange,BLU,115.0,1,"I had originally given this a 4 star rating because although it had problems it also offers a lot of great features for the price...fast forward a couple weeks and the phone is no longer working. Nothing happened to the phone but it randomly quit working. No new apps, no updates, no falls, no moisture...it just suddenly started restarting repeatedly. It would do that for a minute or so then shut off and I couldn't get it to come back up without a battery pull. Now it won't come back on at all, the screen just flashes. I did try a factory reset during one of the few times it last that long but it didn't help. Removing the sim and memory card didn't help and neither did updating it. I wrote customer service via the blu products website yesterday but I haven't gotten any type of response yet. Looking online showed that it's not an uncommon problem with this phone. I'll give more stars if they fix the problem without a hassle.Other bad things to keep in mind: The time zone sets wrong and has to be changed every time the phone dies or the battery is pulled, the automatic time zone feature needs to be disabled. The alarms don't always work (even when set perfectly), the screen is plastic and scratches insanely easy, cases are impossible to find. I ordered a case from the one and only website I could find that said they sold them for this model and when it arrived it was for something else and was labeled incorrectly, the phone will constantly tell you that you don't have a sim card in the unused slot even though it's obviously not a requirement...The pros: The display is large and bright, the touch screen reads correctly and easily, the phone is beautifully designed, the speaker is loud",26.0,0

Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 16GB Gray-Unlocked International Phone,,116.99,2,"The Galaxy Note 2 is superb in most ways except one. In the battle between nerds and sales people, the nerds have truly won out. By a lot. In other words, it is not consumer-friendly for the average consumer. In setting it up, one is confronted with numerous compulsory choices that are unclear, ambiguous and risky. Though I spent over 4 hours studying the online manual, I now have a costly device where access to what I need is uncertain. And where simple operations on most smart phones seemingly are not available though I suppose they exist somewhere. In conclusion, if you have the knowledge to survive complexity and complications that produce unpredictable results, the Note 2 may be for you. I chose it over an Apple product because of its size and greater visibility -- more like a tablet. I am sorry I did.",5.0,0

"HTC One X Unlocked Gsm Phone, 16GB, Gray",HTC,92.99,5,"I ordered this phone after getting the upgrade HTC One X USA version from AT&T. The international phone is almost the same as the version from AT&T. This international version has a 4 core processor and 32GB of storage unlike the dual core and only 9GB of storage on AT&T's version. This phone will not run on AT&T's LTE network, but it will still run on the 3g network there. All I had to do was get a new Micro SIM chip from AT&T and it was good to go. I currently live in Kuwait and that is why I needed the international version. I would prefer to use this phone then the AT&T version.This phone has the quad core process and right at 23GB of usable storage. There is NO MicroSD slot and it uses a Micro SIM chip. This phone reacts instantly when you open a app. The reboot time on it is faster than any phone I have seen. Great phone all around. thin and light, but still a tad to big to fit in the pocket comfortably. I love this phone and plan to use it for several years to come.",,4

I tried on both networks and all have 4G LTE speed. Great I ditched my Sprint and go for prepaid plan, saving lots of money. I'll give MetroPCS a shot after I'm done with Straight Talk. Will update how MetroPCS network speed.Run Speedtest.net on ATT and T-Mobile 4G LTE hit over 10Mbps without any problem. I have better LTE rate on T-Mobile than AT&T.However it does have some flaws as well - Bloatware, a lot of them. AT&T preloaded bunch of their home brewed bloatware. They eat up tons of internal memory. Unless you rooted your phone and removed those unwanted apps, you just have to live with them and they do drag the overall performance.You will see lags when you launch phone dialer or switching between apps. Considering it's a 2-year-old phone with just dual core and 1GB RAM, I can live with that for a sub $300 price phone.Battery life is miserable. It couldn't even last 8 hours of normal usage. Need to charge everyday and in the car to keep it floating.Overall this is definitely a great phone for it's quality and price. Highly recommended.Updated: Called MetroPCS and tried to use their service. What a joke, their customer said my phone is still locked! I have been with T-mobile prepaid and Straighttalk and no problem at all. That's why this company is dead and bought by T-mobile. You can't activate the SIM Card online and you need to call them and the customer service knows nothing. Hello, this is year 2013 and people still need to call to activate a service and nope you can't do it online.",11.0,0
Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,249.0,5,"When I started researching sub $400 phones after always having to own FLAGSHIP PHONES since 2007 and thinking there is NO REASON anymore to have to pay alot of money for a phone. Then when I read the reviews and saw the Specs on the MOTO G PLUS with it's 4GB of RAM and 64GB HARD drive and MICRO SD CARD SLOT and a 5.5 high resolution screen that I can see in sunlight and a 16MP camera with laser focus and octacore processing and GESTURES built in the OS. I said let's try it for under $300. I was going to buy the OnePLus3. For more money. The phone came in 2 days and being a Galaxy Note 4 user and plugging in my SIM card from my carrier to the MOTO G PLUS I was instantly impressed. NO MESS! NO ISSUES, I set it up as a NEW PHONE and only loaded APPS I wanted and accounts I wanted and battery lasting all day and nice and smooth so far and very easy to use. The screen is crystal clear and so far I love it. Charges up really fast. The sound Quality is AMAZING as a phone and average through the speaker not bad. What will I do with the $600 I saved from not ordering a FLAGSHIP PHONE? Put it towards a massage chair I have my eye on for $1200.",2.0,4

Works well, very fast processor, durable, fairly light, excelling high def screen, many amazing features. Seems pretty durable, too. The two gripes I have with it are (1) the auto-correct function. Doesn't correct English well, and when you do find the word you are looking for, it doesn't replace but inserts it so that you have to delete the erroneous one. Doesn't correct the usual error of inserting a b, n or v instead of a space. Frustrating. and (2) there is no microphone / dictation feature like on other Droids or IPhones, etc. So no hands-free typing. However, definitely outstanding phone for reasonable price.",0.0,4

The phone is great, features and ease of use are also excellent, network connectivity works well on GSM carrier T-Mobile in central Florida, basically I get 42 Mbps speed using their 1700 and 1900 bands for HSPD+ speeds. Quality of construction is excellent, nice AMOLED screen, perfect size for my wife that doesn't need a 5"" tablet phone that is hard to balance in one hand. The items that one has to be aware of are it is the S5 mini 3G WCDMA, 2G GSM phone, it a international version made for the African/Arabian markets (Persia in particular) and therefore there is no US warranty on this item at all. Get a SquareTrade warranty! As a matter of fact, you can't even register it on the http://www.samsung.com/za/consumer/mobile-phone/ website. This model has the G800HXXU1ANGF modem that is compatible on North American carriers, the Android version is the G800HXXU1ANH5 (KitKat 4.4.2). For less than half the price of the S5 locked version from US carriers, it is well worth the price and one is not locked in to a specific carrier.

"Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803 16GB 4G LTE 4.6"" Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Black - International Version No Warranty",,244.0,1,"After a couple years of beating the crap out of my Z1 compact I finally managed to break the screen so decided it was time for an upgrade to the Z3 compact. After three months of using the Z3 compact I have replaced the broken screen on the Z1 and gone back to that. Here's why:1) Feel. The Z1 Compact is a more solid feeling device. I have literally thrown it across the room several dozens of times with only a few scratches as result (the broken screen was the result of accidentally hitting an end table corner). Where as the Z1 C has nice aluminum sides, the Z3 C has flimsy feeling plastic. I'd be afraid to have it fall from my pocket, much less be thrown across the room.2. Quality. After less than a month of use the door around the sim card failed. It just would not stay fully sealed, instead it sat ""half ajar"" and this is a compartment that I never had to open except on accident when fumbling in the dark to get to the usb plug. The sim cover now sits sealed shut with silicone sealant. After a second month the usb cover started doing the same thing. Speaking of usb, two months in and you have to have the cord sitting just right in the plug to get a charge, bump the phone slightly so the cord moves and it stops charging.3. Battery. The Z3 sucks down juice when you are doing anything on it. If you leave location service (normal, not even enhanced) running expect a dead phone in your pocket in under 8 hours without having used it.4. Heat. If I lived in a cold weather climate I would love the Z3 Compact. After 20 minutes of moderate use and you can pass it around your skiing friends to thaw them out. It actually gets uncomfortably warm playing games (which must be done while plugged in or your battery will be dead in no time).4. Sony Android Update. The final straw was the android updates which nerfed email for me. Used to be messages from my four accounts would popup in the alerts, click on one and itd bring me to that email (single) or account (multiple new emails). Click the next alert and it brings you over to that message/account. After updates it brings you to the most recent email/account you had open and clears the alerts. Sony released another update shortly after which I had hoped would fix this, but no dice. Just more annoying Sony apps (which granted is on par with Samsung and Motorola crap apps).",0.0,0

"BLU VIVO 5 Smartphone -5.5"" 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 32GB +3GB RAM - Silver",BLU,199.95,4,"This is my second BLU phone, my first one being the Vivo Air LTE which was an excellent phone minus the battery. The update, or evolution, of that phone is the Vivo 5. At 200 USD it's excellent. This was my first phone over the 5"" screen size so I wasn't entirely sure I'd like a larger device, but it was easy to adapt too and I can now see the benefits. Screen: At a mere 720p it might sound too low, and I almost didn't buy the device because of it, but could immediately tell it was still a very good display. It's plenty sharp for media consumption and reading online articles, which is most of my heavy use case. Gaming looks good and everything I've tried whether indie or triple A title it played them just fine. It's plenty bright for viewing in direct sunlight. Colors are good, and because it's an AMOLED panel your blacks are ""inky"" black. Performance: This has been a smooth performing device. It's snappy out of the box with its 3GB of RAM but I'm the kind of user that disables and turns of any app or feature I don't use. The reality is that Android phones have gotten to a point where something at this price point is stable and fast enough to accomplish the tasks of 90 percent of the users out there. Even for power used like myself the good performance matches battery life which has always gotten me through an entire day with plenty to spare. Build Quality: Again this is an obvious concern at this price point but I was pretty confident with my last phone being BLU device. This new phone doesn't disappoint. It feels extremely premium and it's held up great over the last month of use. I rock my phones naked and it hardly shows any signs of wear. No scratches, dents, or wearing of the color. What I don't like: Okay, so yeah there's going to be some sacrifices. I don't like the stock launcher which ditches the app drawer. I highly recommend installing NOVA launcher or Google Now launcher to get your app drawer back. NOVA launcher allows you to resize icons, which is a must because a screen size with this resolution makes the icons almost comically big (those with poor vision might disagree). The setting interface is too simple, and most power users will find what they need in ""advanced"" settings which is kind of a laugh. Lastly the camera. It appears to shoot outdoor photos just fine, they're respectably good. Indoor photos are awful. I hate using the flash, but in this case it's a requirement and even still your photos will be blown out and grainy. Maybe the update to Android M will fix some of this? Conclusion: It's absolutely worth the price. There is a plethora of good features baked into this phone I haven't mentioned. The double tap to wake and gesture app launching from screen off are nice touches and deserve an honorable mention. With a little personalizing this device will not disappoint. I highly recommend it.

"Nokia Lumia 1020 RM-877 GSM Unlocked 32GB Windows 8.1 4G LTE Smartphone - Black (International version, No Warranty)",Nokia,337.0,5,"I shoot all of my photos in RAW DNG format with this phone and the image quality years ahead of anything else on the market other than perhaps the Nokia 808 Pureview which also has a 41 megapixel sensor. Even after it's been available for well over a year, this phone is still the best. With the new Windows Phone 8.1 upgrade, all the other phone functions are just as good if not better than the other smartphones out there. The MixRadio app is awesome too. With that you get free unlimited offline music playlists! You can download up to 4 playlists at a time based on 1-3 artist styles and listen to them without having to deal with streaming-internet coverage. The ""Play Me"" button is so so good too. One touch to listen to the music you like and it doesn't use the data plan. No need for Pandora, Spotify, etc., but those apps are available too.I only wish that it had a removable battery so I could replace it with more juice on the go... and a Micro SD card slot so that I could store more 40 Mb DNG photos.",2.0,4

Why didn't they put the soft keys there instead of (second issue) taking up a half inch of the bottom of the screen with them? And finally, the speaker sucks.

Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,59.95,5,"I got my first GSM qwerty phone for free when I renewed my contract in 2010. It was a touchscreen Samsung with a slide-out keyboard. Because the phone unlocks if the slider is budged, there was no way to secure the phone from pocket dialing. While I was camping one night the phone called 911 four times even though I had ""locked"" it. I couldn't access my employer voicemail with this phone because it had no hard keys, and the screen keypad presented no pound sign (#) which is needed to get into my voicemail system. And, if my cheek brushed the screen on other voicemail systems, it would activate a number on the screen causing the message to be deleted, passed, saved, etc.So I paid retail to my provider (GCI) for my next phone, an Alcatel qwerty candybar style phone. Although I wanted a non-touchscreen phone, GCI only sells GSM texters that have touchscreen menu systems even if they have hard keys for texting and dialing. This phone had a better locking scheme than the Samsung but it too was regularly defeated in my pocket (but it did not make spurious 911 calls).Both the Samsung and Alcatel are of high quality but I hate them for their touchscreens.So...A couple of months ago I bought the unlocked Nokia C3-00 phone from Amazon. It is a dream compared to my other phones. The radio has far better FM reception than the Samsung or Alcatel; the battery lasts WAY longer than my past phones; the menu system is natural, better designed, and faster than the touchscreens; the keypad is easy to see and has a very good touch; the screen quality is bright and clear; and the phone STAYS locked when you lock it. Call quality is excellent. WiFi is easy and fast, and I remain happy not to spend an extra $30 per month (PLUS data plan cost) to have a smart phone.Two teensy cons for me with this phone, both cheaply resolved:(1) The back of body of this solidly built phone is slick. I don't want the phone falling out of my breast pocket or my hand so I ordered from Amazon ""Amzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for Nokia C3 - Black by Amzer"" for about $10. The case slips on perfectly and keeps the phone comfortably secure while I am on a call; and it keeps the phone in one place no matter where I put it down. It also muffles the Nokia's enthusiastic vibration when I want to be alerted to a call or text but don't want to buzz the desktop.(2) The sound quality of the comfortable and ergonomically well-designed earbuds is muffled-sounding. So I simply substitute the original earbuds from an old iPod. They are sufficient for providing the Nokia's superior FM reception and they sound better than the Nokia buds.When my cell phone contract comes up in a couple of months I will take a free phone if I can get the little Samsung ruggedized waterproof phone for when I'm camping or fishing. But I will keep using the Nokia C3-00 as my primary phone beause it is perfect for my normal pattern of phone usage.",1.0,4

HTC One M8 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Smartphone - Amber Gold,,190.99,3,"Normally I don't like to write bad reviews for products I buy, but this time I thought I would shine some light on this phone. First off I'd like to talk about the ""first impression."" When I ordered the phone, I ordered a 32gb phone, and received a 16gb phone instead. I emailed the company that send it, assuming they would replace it, and I have yet to hear back. I have Consumer Cellular, and I installed the SIM card as instructed. It would only let me text and call, but it would not let me use data at all. The third thing that made me decide to get a different phone was the microphone was broken. No matter who I called or what setting I chose, the person on the other end of the phone could not hear me.Overall;Pros:-Phone is fast-Awesome resolution and picture-Good cameraCons:-Home screen navigation takes getting used to-Original start up was in a foreign language-Microphone did not work-Data would not work-Sent wrong phoneHopefully this helps!",,0

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked - Prime Exclusive - with Lockscreen Offers & Ads,Motorola,149.99,5,"I think that it is so because as with some other things we can find now, it was designed to give full capabilities, ruggedness, and long life to persons in non-first-world countries. Thus the replaceable battery, the full set of bands and great performance of Motorola's most up-to-date designs, and even the size, which is comfortable and large enough.I've found performance to be excellent, all around an area which used to be somewhat fringe on a good Sony feature phone. The 4G is flawless with T-Mobile, when I want to pay for data by an add-on pass to my $3/mo pay-as-go plan, and it's fast -- twice my cable internet.Running on wifi, I'm surprised to find that even watching a film is satisfying, and the sound with good earbuds is rich.Calls and receiving calls and SMS can be entirely free on wifi, not using your minutes, if you are careful to understand setting up Google Voice and Dialer. Just be sure to understand that you don't want forwarding to the phone when using this mode of Google services, or they would go on your plan minutes.. Get someone to help if the web instructions seem hard.The bonus is that this phone integrates wifi or 4g-data calling via Google seamlessly, so that you use your phone in the slick way Motorola has arranged it - just one extra tap as you make a call, to choose Google or your cell provider.The Marshmallow level of Android is very well developed and smooth with Motorola's no-interference way of providing it -- plus the Google services you can add offer quite a lot, even including what seem to offer just as much by now as Siri. You can voice-type effectively, and there is swipe typing, a big advance on fingers or thumbs, if those are well provided for also. You can ask for Google lookups in a moment, then return to the note you were writing or the call you are on. You can ask to make appointments. where to find a laundromat or a meal, and so forth., and it all actually works.I'd have to say that as an actual old hand on what goes into these things, I feel a real sense of using something already travelling into a future.The ads -- actually, the Amazon ads are so far almost always tasteful, I know because I made an effort to look. If you have notifications, you are only going to see those ads as the same small notes,, very unobtrusive. I find the cacophony of other ads all through using some apps to be the real issue, and those have nothing to do with Amazon. The answer to them is to choose your apps from those which are tasteful about this, and that is something you can easily do.Your choice, then. If you're not intent on spinning around with Pokemon, or playing reflex-demanding games, you might also find this quite a valuable bargain. I would suggest trying one out in a store, to see about the size, and then you can also learn about the smoothness. Style too, as this is always personal.",23.0,4

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,5,"my father is not into fancy smartphones or texting or using his phone to surf the net. what he is into is a phone that keeps on working if its been accidentally dropped. he's been using the same old flip phone for a few years now which finally started having issues. i did lots of research on phones and felt this would be the best phone for him. i was a little hesitant at first since it was refurbished but due to reviews i figured it was worth a shot. plus cheap enough that if it only works for a year, he can get another for cheap. it arrived and looked a little used (a little wear in the paint but not much) but that's ok. especially for the big savings over a new one. at least 50% of the price. he says it works great. he says the ringer is nice and loud and he is blown away with bluetooth lol. its been a couple of months now and i ive asked him a few times about it and he has nothing but positive things to say about it. no issues yet.",2.0,4

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 256 GB - US Version (Rose Gold),Apple,908.99,5,"If anyone is interested to know how the 7 performs compared to the 6 and 6sCamera is a little better and you notice it for sure. It is a lot better in low lights conditions.SPEED, I was using a 6s and I notice a much snappier Safari and iMessage screens. Part of it may be IOS 10 but pages pop really fast. It is way way faster than the original 6.Black looks awesome!!! But is is so slick. There are no lines and it looks like a solid 1 piece product. I saw the Glossy Jet Black and it is a work of art but it show fine scratches. So most people will use a case which hides the back anyway so maybe color is not that important. Mainly if you want a white front or black.I love the new home button, took about 5 minutes to get use to and I don't miss the old home button at all.Any case with a large camera cutout like the CM4 wallet case works with the 7. But most likely all other will not. Some of mine I can cut out around the old camera hole and use it until new cases come out. But I promise you this phone is slippery when dry!!Overall I love it! Fastest device that I have ever used. I can out type the 6s sometimes on reviews but thiamine keep up no problem.128g is perfect in size for most everyone. Hardcore photo and video people may want the 256g.No headphone jack, doesn't bother me at all. The adapter sounds fine with my expensive headphones. It's not really that large either. The lightning headphones sound really good to me. I tested the same song with the same headphone using a 6s and the 7 with the adapter and I cannot tell the difference. In some ways the 7 with the adpater sounded cleaner and had a little less aliasing hiss from the analog to digital conversion process. So beside have a little while cable sticking out I think the 7 audio is fine.IPhone 4,5, 5s, SE and 6 users will feel a huge speed increase. The 6s is not far off speed wise but it is noticeable to me.No matter how you split up the payment or go with a upgrade contract price, you'll pay full price for any of the phones. It is all just creative math by the vendors. I bought mine outright and got point on my credit card, enough to reduce my price by $25.00. I also heard the Black and Jet Blacks maybe high in demand.Hope this helps :)",73.0,4

Oh, did I mention that you have to run a garbage coded scammy looking app and service in the background of the host phone, above and beyond the bluetooth connection, for any of this to ""work""?Camera quality is poor.

"BLU Life Pure Unlocked Phone 32GB ROM, 2GB RAM (White)",BLU,150.0,4,"Blu has always been known to have decent Android phones. With their Life series they raised the bar and with this Pure phone they hopped over the bar and landed on their two feet. Quad Core processor, 2GB of ram, and 32GB of storage.The phone itself is built like a champ. A solid 1 piece of polycarbonate encloses the phones massive 5 inch full hd display with IPS technology. The camera is 13mp on the back and boy does it shoot and take some good videos and pictures. Easily bests my Nexus 4's 8mp. The phone is slim and it feels really good in the hand. Like I said the build quality is fantastic.It has all the wireless you want, but with no NFC. 2.4 gHz bands for wifi only. GPS and bluetooth are here (4.0) So why did this only get 4 stars and not 5?Very simple. The GPU on this is two years old. The powerVR graphics card. Now that is not bad for a device with a 720p display or lower, but when you are pushing 440+ PPI, you need a more powerful one. The CPU is by Mediatek and truthfully, they make good processors. No complaints with that, but that GPU is a soar spot. There are two live wallpapers that I really like, and they would not run at all on this device. Just completely bogged down the phone. I know many people love FHD phones, but maybe this device should have had a 720pP display and not the FHD with this GPU. Otherwise excellent phone and I cannot wait to see what else Blu brings in the future. They also mentioned a 4.4 update coming by the end of Q2 2014. Worth a look.EDIT: March 3rd 2014. Friday I used it outside as a GPS. GPS satellites, and WiFI plus all the Google location permissions turned on and the phone for over 10 minutes could not pick up a precise location. After the 10 mins I just gave up. Returned the phone as Amazon did not have the white in stock per my return. Really a shame too, it is a really nice phone. Not sure if my unit was defective as per the GPS module, but I did in fact return it. Maybe later down the road when Amazon gets the white in stock, I'll pick up another one.

BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Smartphone - Unlocked - Yellow,BLU,2000.0,4,"My review is divided into sections based on things I want to comment about.UI: Nice, snappy, bright and clear display.BATTERY: Battery lasted a day with some usage, and some phone calls, at the end of the about 30% was still remaining. Drains faster with wifi enabled.BLUETOOTH: Didn't work with Toyota Prius, connection always fail. That was a bummer for me.VOICE INPUT: Voice input is very accurate. Even though I am not a native speaker, it still gets me right every time!SYSTEM UPDATES: Received two system updates, one from March, and one from April. Currently running build ""BLU_D535U_V10_GENERIC 29-04-215 14:24"".SOFTWARE UPDATES: Received updates for several Google apps.CELLULAR DATA: I use PureTalkUSA that is an AT&T MVNO. Data connectivity on PureTalkUSA worked like a charm. Showed 4G and browsing was pretty fast.STORAGE: After all these updates and having installed Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook Messenger, storage shows 4.82GB available. Not bad at all.MULTI-TASKING: I'm running Facebook, Messenger, Messaging (that's system's SMS app), WhatsApp, Chrome with a couple tabs, Play Store, Google (that voice driven search app), YouTube, Gmail, and phone response very well. Switching is fast. No issues to me. My $300+ phone is slightly better but I honestly cannot complain at this price point. It is definitely performing much better than my expectations.Overall I am pleased with the phone and do recommend it if you don't have to pair it with Prius. But since I rely heavily on car's bluetooth connectivity, unfortunately it is not a keeper. It will be a great phone for my wife though. I'll pass it on to her.",2.0,4

The only thing I am having a bit of an issue with is the music sync. It could be me but I am pretty computer savy so I doubt it. I synced my music to the phone from windows media center and when I try to play a song it says the phone does not play this file format. I checked with the guidelines and the phone support and it says it does. so there is clearly something wrong. Because wmc files are support for this phone. I am sure it will get resolved. I am a huge music lover and I have a large extensive music collection. I would be more than disappointed if this does not get resolved. Needless to say microsoft hit a home run on every other aspect of this phone. It is more like a computer experience than a phone. So .99 percent blown away by this phone. All other applications worked flawlessly. It has online and offline sync you just need to configure it. Both Microsoft and Nokia have downloads for this.

LG G2 D800 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE 2.26 GHz Quad-Core Android Smartphone with 13 MP Camera (White),LG,199.99,2,"We were so excited for this phone after the many excellent reviews. However, the phone we received had a dead zone through the entire left column of the touch screen. This obviously is a problem if you expect to use all of the keys on your keyboard or be able to move things to the left of the screen. After returning the product for a replacement we were VERY happy that the entire screen worked. However, after only a few days it became clear that the phone was not picking up the correct network (4G LTE through ATT). This phone would only detect the Edge network (which is so slow you may as well not have access to a network at all). This had not been a problem with the first phone or with other different phones in the same area. Hours with IT support verifying all software updates, IMEI numbers, access points, etc were fruitless and it came down to yet another product defect. Disappointed, we returned the product but this time for a full refund. It seems that if we had been lucky enough to get a fully functioning product that this phone could have been incredible. We loved the camera, the speed, the size, the memory, the battery life. But none of that mattered if you couldn't use the whole screen or have access to your carrier's network. Both problems were not singular to us - we could find many threads online with other customers experiencing the same things. Wasn't worth the gamble for a third try for us. Too bad.",,0

I got the rose gold and he got the black one. The rose gold color wasn't as rosy as I thought it would be, it's more of a champagne color. The black one looks very sophisticated and elegant. I must say that I was not a fan of Samsung borrowing Apple's idea of no memory storage and making it difficult to put the sim card in but it was an easy fix with being able to send all of my extra photos to my Samsung account. Upon arrival, the packaging makes sure the product is not harmed whatsoever (lots and lots of bubble wrap). In all honesty I was afraid the phone was not going to hold up very long because of the glass edge and because I'm prone to dropping my phone...a lot. However even with out a case it has held up quite well. The photo quality of the front and rear camera is amazing, definitely a step (or two) up from the S5. We decided to buy on amazon because the price listed was $200-$300 cheaper than buying in stores, plus free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime.

BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - US GSM - White,BLU,101.91,3,"Received the phone after waiting 2 weeks when it was released was and SUPER excited after it was on sale for 85 bucks! I had to buy it! There is a lot to talk about lol The phone has 2 SIM cards, Slot 1 is for 4G and 3G signal while Slot 2 is 2G next to the battery which you must removed to access. Dont forget the SD card slot. Battery life is great it lasts me to the end of the day just from texts, videos and web. The screen is awesome 5.5 inches, 720p goodness! I have big hands and it is still hard for my thumb to reach to the corner of the screen, capacitive buttons to squeeze out more size I would assume. Volume buttons and the power button are located on the right side of the device, headphone jack on top and charger port on the bottom. Weight on the phone is okay though it is not balanced very well, there have been times where ive had the phone go over my index finger. (Big hands) The camera is okay 8MP with a LED light to accompany it. Front camera is 2MP which I dont really care for unless youre a selfie person or for skype for pictures youll be using those filters to help the image quality lol. The back speaker is a bit too loud in my opinion. Great phone for the price! Bloat-free, I have rooted the device with Kingo Root. Now the bad stuff oh boy..BAD!1. The smartphone did not attempt to read my 32G SD card, Ive tried MANY cards on the device and nothing. I asked for a replacement for the dead SD slot which came in to days woo! Grabbed the new replacement aaaaaand IT DID NOT WORK! Really frustrating since I have tons of music on those cards.2. On both devices Ive had the same problem. The battery seems to be picky about what phone charger can and CANT charge it! What the...3. While charging, the top half of the huge screen becomes unresponsive! Bringing down the notification bar at the home screen is almost impossible while charging. (Maybe its the voltage coming into the device??)4.So MANY bugs on the UI, such as the swipe lock screen. I touch the bubble swipe to the right and the it unlocks and locks immediately! to access my home screen I must go through my notifications bar and menus menus menus. Another example, the dial pad, dialing numbers lags really bad.5. Im not sure if it is specific apps (YouTube etc.) or the wifi hardware, but while watching 720p videos they seem to buffer too often. Making HD videos almost unwatchable. It could be the 4.4.2 KitKat OS that is contributing to 95% of these problems and hopefully they will be fixed with the 5.0 Lollipop upgrade which the ETA on that is unknown. Otherwise its a GOOD starting phone with decent specs but if problems continue to arise I might will return this phone and spend 75 bucks more for a better upgrade. I could bump to 4 stars if 5.0 Lollipop comes in.",12.0,2

I don't like the round prongs power plug, but I had an adapter since I have lived in Shanghai for the past several years. I think the user interface is simply horrible to use. The various functions are needlessly buried in layers of senseless options. Try to make a call to a company that says press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish, etc. You have to press and hold the touch screen area called unlock. Then you have to press another area to get a touch screen numeral pad. By the time you get to this point, the number you called is asking you if you want to repeat the options. The microprocessor in this phone must be the slowest on earth. Everything is so slow and counterintuitive that I get upset everytime I use it. In text mode, they use the same layout as a digital phone. Why they didn't have the option of a Qwerty keyboard is beyond logic. So there you are pressing every button once, twice or three times when it could have been a full keyboard layout. It does have the option where it tries to guess the word you are spelling, which is good. The phone is usable, but frustrating to use in my opinion. I tried to give it to my brother, but he returned it to me saying it has the worst user interface in the world and he wouldn't take it even if I paid him money.",2.0,0

Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - Global GSM Unlocked Phone,Motorola,109.99,2,"I have purchased a Moto E for each of my two teenagers, and they both really like the phones and they actually prefer its smaller size to larger phones available because they are easier to keep in a pocket. My more tech-savvy teen immediately encountered issues with the storage capacity, even with a 16-GB SD card installed. Some apps just are not able to be moved to the SD card or require a certain amount of internal storage to function.The biggest problem we have encountered is the apparently common issue with the headphone jack/speaker cutting in and out. It first happened to one phone, and then the other. The first phone I returned and bought a new one, and so far the replacement is not having the issue (it's been about 2 months now). The second one I just returned and also rebought, and am hoping that its replacement will fare better as well.Update: One of the replacements has now developed the same jack issues and is going back. I have therefore officially given up on the Moto E, as three out of four Moto E's have had the same headphone jack issue, and all within weeks of purchase. Both of the kids are heavy music listeners, so I think the maybe the problem emerged faster with us than with the average user. Weirdly, the only phone that did not have the jack issue was white, whereas the other three were black. Anyway, dropping my rating down to 2 stars and forking out more for a better phone. Hope Motorola addresses this in the next generation.",,0

"Huawei Ascend Mate 7 Factory Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, White",HUAWEI,299.99,5,"Very glad I took a chance on this device. Build quality is solid. Screen is big and beautiful. Phone pulls a strong signal (compared to my G3 anyway), and the UI is *very* unobtrusive. It's not going to win any land speed records for specs or horsepower, but this phone functions reliably and does what it does very well. The battery life is wonderful. Seems I can get 8-9 hours of moderately heavy usage SOT with the device set to auto brightness. I am using ATT gophone and I slipped the sim card in and instantly got data, LTE, etc. Didn't have to mess with the APN settings at all in my case. Wi-Fi Tethering is baked in, and so is a wonderful immersive mode that gives you more screen real estate by auto hiding the soft keys (uhhhhhhh, Google why is this not on EVERY Android device?). I give the device 5 stars not because it's objectively superior compared to other flagship smartphones (it's not....at least not regarding internals). But because its ""dollar to practical feature"" value is so high. If you just want a phone that works well, with a good/mildly intrusive UI, Hulk-like strength in battery life, wonderful screen, solid build quality--and if your ego can take it when you get that quizzical look after an inquiry, and you tell them it's a Huawei (""waah-way"")--then this may indeed be the device for you.P.S., my phone shipped with 4.4.2.

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Silver,BLU,139.0,4,"I have it for a month. This phone looks and feels fine for the price, however there are the following issues ( concerns)1. Camera 8 megapixels pictures look like 0.5 megapixels (number is for comparison only) . Quality is poor , but ok for basic pictures. For me it is not a big deal, since I prefer to use more advanced cameras for shooting.2. GPS is unreliable , Android 5.0 users complain a lot, this could be related. Provider is T-Mobile, but I tried turning off mobile network and using only GPS, same thing. It looses connection to satellites and says ""searching for GPS"" indefinitely. Navigation can't be used at all. HUGE concern.3. Contacts and phone application do not do the job. I have 400 contacts, sometimes they load, sometimes they do not. I could not find out what it depends on. Reboots, wiping cache partition and other tricks I found do not help. It might take up to 5 minutes till contacts appear. Searching is also i very slow. I tried Exdialer from google play, comes with contacts application as well, works a little better. However I see the same issue, contacts are not loading for a long time. reboots do not help. HUGE concern4. T-Mobile Visual voicemail did not work when SIM card was in an outside slot, moved it to the inside slot it works just fine.5. BLU Help application on the phone is not functioning6. Bloatware is present, but not nearly as much as on T-mobile phones. I was able to disable most of it. Some examples : Amazon apps, various google apps , Music Visualization Wallpapers. Opera browser., Photo screensavers, etc.7. Microphone is in the right bottom corner. I am right handed. While holding this phone by the right ear, and holding it with the left hand, in case I need to operate a mouse on a computer, I close the mic. Need to learn to say ""hold on"" to someone on the line and move the phone to the left ear. Not a big deal, but I keep forgetting and people complain they can't hear me.I messaged BLU support, listing these concerns, will update this review once I get a response.If the above issues with GPS and Contacts are addressed I would be very happy with my phone. I need it for basic things, I do not play games and I am OK with poor quality camera. So far, I have a feeling that it might be Android 5.0 related, since I see that people with 5.1 claim that had such issues addressed. Phone is performing well otherwise. I did not see any issues with WiFi or bluetooth.----------------------------------------------------------Update-----------------------------------------------------------I received a response to my inquiry from BLU, it had the following instructions to reset my phone. That should have solved my issues with contacts. After the phone was reset, it worked indeed. The problem is I had to reinstall all apps, and load my information to the phone again.The phone is working fine, I increased rating from 3 to 4. The things I still do not like and wish they were better.1. Bad quality camera - I am fine with this2. Unreliable GPS - I am not fine with this, but can live with another option I have.----------------------------------------------------------Letter from BLU----------------------------------------------------------Hello,Thank you for contacting BLU Products.

"LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smart Phone, 5.2"" Quartz White, 32GB Storage, US Warranty",LG Electronics,399.0,5,"I've had a Nexus 5 for almost 2 years, and I was very happy with it. When I first got it, it seemed large (moved from a Galaxy Nexus), though compared to the 5X, it's on the small side. My N5 has been running Marshmallow since the OTA went out, and there was nothing really wrong with it, except for a fading battery and some minor annoyances. For one, I kept having intermittent camera crashes that required a reboot, it didn't reliably hop onto known WiFi, so I'd have to shut off WIFi and turn it back on whenever I got home, and WiFi never seemed to connect at work. Everything else was butter-smooth, however, and it was still a very good phone. So why did I switch? Mostly the battery life. I could no longer get through a full day, and recently in a movie theater I went from 77% to 13% battery in 90 minutes, and this was with the new Doze feature in Marshmallow. So I decided to go with the 5X, which is the first true update to the N5. While the reviews talk about how the 5X is the same size as the N5, the new phone is noticeably bigger. I can hold it in one hand, but I can't reach the corners of the screen as well as I could with my N5. I love the fingerprint scanner on the back - that's the best feature so far. I also am very happy with the battery life. The last two days, in light use, I got home in the evening with 60-70% battery remaining. Mind you, I'm using it to check my calendar, a few e-mails, texts and the like. No gaming or video (I'm working!) This is great, and with the Doze feature, I sometimes see only a 1-2% drop in battery life over the course of an hour or two when I'm not using it. It also has the Sensor Hub feature, which means that new messages show up in light B&W on the screen as they come in. If I pick up the phone and just move it a bit, the B&W notifications will appear. If I want to get to them, I touch the fingerprint sensor once and I'm immediately at the last screen I was on. It's really quick and easy to use.It was last on the charger 3 hours ago, and it's at 91%. This is much better than I did with the N5. Speaking of the charger, it is kind of annoying that I have to have new cables. Knowing this would happen, I ordered 2 extra USB-A to USB-C cables when I ordered the phone, as well as a case (Ringke Slim - very minimalist). So I have a cable at work (which I haven't used since the battery life is good), one in the car and one at home. Only the one that came with the phone has rapid charging, and I haven't really needed to charge rapidly yet, so I don't know how fast it is. There are some rapid-charging accessories out there, so I might try them later. Rapid charging is the upside to losing wireless charging. I had 2 wireless charging slabs for my N5, and I used them all the time. I'll miss those, but we have compromises. All in all, I'm happy!",9.0,4

Samsung Galaxy S3 SGH-i747 4G LTE GSM Unlocked 16GB No Warranty (White),Samsung,88.0,3,"The phone works without any problems with a few exceptions.The slightest flaw I noticed was the back cover is slightly bent, as if it's been attached and detached by a previous owner multiple times.The greatest flaw is the battery is not from the original manufacturer. It's 3.7 volts (original is 3.8v), doesn't have NFC (near field communication) which enables some key features, i.e. touching two phones (with NFC) together to transfer data, Google wallet, etc. Also, with phone off and charging to full then turning phone on, the battery always reads at 85%. The battery itself doesn't show Samsung. I thought it was odd that this this new galaxy s3 was getting worse battery life than my old galaxy s2, since it reportedly has better battery life and the battery is almost 1/3 larger than the s2. Consequently, I have to buy a new battery.In the next couple of weeks, I will confirm if this phone is truly unlocked.",,0

Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom 16MP Camera Android Smartphone - White (International Version),Samsung,325.0,4,"I purchased the S4 Zoom because I wanted a versatile all-in-one Smartphone/Digital Point and Shoot Optical Zoom Camera/Video Camcorder so that I wouldn't need to carry around multiple devices either for everyday use or for traveling. I would rate the S4 Zoom differently depending on how I am using it.4.5 stars as a Smartphone. The S4 Zoom has a smaller, lower resolution screen, lesser processor, and may be missing some of the non-essential software and interface tricks (such as hovering gestures) found on the regular Galaxy S4, but for the most part it does a great job making calls, running apps, giving GPS assisted directions, surfing the web, video and music playback and most every other function you might want your Smartphone/mini-computer to do.4.0 stars as a Camera for taking digital photographs. I also own a two year old Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS10 with 16x optical (21x digital) zoom range, but which like the S4 zoom has a 16 megapixel CMOS sensor. I consider the DMC-ZS10 to be very good for taking both photos and video. While I knew I would be sacrificing some zoom range with the S4 zoom, which is only 10x optical zoom, in most other respects, both in image quality and functionality, I found the S4 Zoom to be nearly as good or in some case better than the DMC-ZS10 when taking photographs. (Please note that my opinion on image quality is based on viewing the images on a computer or hd television screen, since I do not generally print photographs to paper anymore).2.0 stars as a Video Camcorder. The S4 Zoom takes good quality video as long as you are not using the zoom function. Once you start using the zoom the problems appear. The most glaring problem is a lack of continuous auto focus while zooming. (The lack of continous auto focus can also be a problem when using the burst function in the camera mode). The S4 Zoom isn't the smoothest performer when zooming in and out, and it easily loses focus when doing so. Whenever you stop zooming, the autofocus function pushes the lens in and out to refocus the image, but this results in very jerky video. Another problem is a very noisy zoom mechanism which is picked up on the audio, even in the quiet zoom mode. My DMC-ZS10 is a far superior performer in all of these respects when it comes to taking smooth focused video with minimal camera noise while using the zoom. I do like the fact that the S4 zoom has a micro SD card slot for extra memory when shooting hd video. An extra battery or two are essential if you plan to shoot a lot of photos or video during the day without recharging.3.5 stars is my Overall Rating, which I rounded up to 4 stars above because I like the overall functionality of the device (and Amazon does not allow you to give partial star ratings). I very much like the idea of the marriage of a Smartphone with an optical zoom camera for those of us who would like the ability to take high quality photos and videos in a variety of situations including when it is not always possible to get closer to the action, without the inconvenience of having to carry around multiple devices. To my knowledge the S4 Zoom is a first in this regard. The poor video performance when using the zoom was a big disappointment to me, however, and I may still need to carry around my other camera when I want to record high quality video using the zoom. Had I known about this weakness beforehand and I hadn't been in urgent need of replacing my old Smartphone, which had died, I might have held off until an upgraded version of this product came out. My hope is that Samsung and other companies will not abandon the idea of such hybrid devices but will continue to develop products along these lines. The technologies already exist on separte devices, the challenge is to combine them in one truly high quality all-in-one device.My wishlist for the next iteration of the S4 Zoom: (1) Fix the autofocus and noise problems when using the zoom during video capture. (2) Add a manual zoom ring or lever around or near the shutter button, to allow for one handed operation of the zoom when shooting video or taking pictures. (3) Up the optical zoom range as much as possible, as long as you can keep the dimensions of the device within reason, i.e. something that can be carried around in a pants pocket.",66.0,4
Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,408.0,4,"Purchased on February, now reviewing during August.The Sony Z5 Compact is a great little device with plenty of powerful features.Specs:2GB ramQualcomm Snapdragon 81023 MP Back Camera (wow!)5 MP Front CameraMicro USB Charging Port4.6 inch Touch Screen DisplayIP 68 Waterproof, Dust proof, etc.Micro SD and Nano SIm card slotsReview:Wow!, I'm surprised Sony was able to compact their larger Z5 into such a small body that is convenient for your pocket and your hand. It is truly some remarkable engineering. Well, that compact size does have a drawback that may put some people off which is that it is a blocky/bulky phone. Even though it is a blocky/bulky phone, I always managed to get a nice firm grip because of the size and bulk of the phone. The screen size is perfect in my opinion for the size of this phone which is the same screen size for the iPhone 6/6s. The phone is also waterproof and dustproof which was sort of a minor, yet surprising, thing that Sony would usually put on their phones that is beginning to be used by other phone companies such as Samsung. The Camera packs 23 MP which is quite surprising for the size of the phone. The camera takes good pictures and good videos, HOWEVER, in only good lighting. If you take pictures in the dark, It will appear murky and pixelated. The phone's software experience has been vastly improved from its early beginnings and has lost almost all of its setbacks it had when it started. Sony's android skin is fast and simple, offering a near stock Android Marshmallow experience. The Speakers produce good sound but are located in the most convenient location that most phone companies ignore. The speakers are located in the front with one on top near the camera and one on the bottom. This means you don't cover the speakers when ever you're watching a video in landscape. Most companies put the speakers at the bottom of the phone next to the Micro USB charging port. The biggest grip of the phone is the processor that is encased in it which is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810. This CPU has a well known record of producing more heat than most of other CPUs in the market. This CPU is very powerful and still relevant even with Qualcomm's new CPU the Snapdragon 820, but it just gets hot very quickly. The heat isn't hot to the touch where it is unbearable it just gets warm when gaming, browsing the web, watching videos, etc. The battery life on this phone is great and it usually has enough charge to last me for a whole day and some the day afterwards. This is, However, if you utilize Sony's STAMINA Battery saver feature. You can still get a whole days worth without it, but you will probably have to cut back on CPU intensive tasks. Overall, this phone offers the strength and speed of its older counterpart(Z5) in a neat little package that doesn't make it uncomfortable in the pocket.Pros:Speed and power( CPU).Small and convenient package.Great front and back cameras.Great battery life.Speaker location is very good and sound great.Waterproof.Cons:CPU gets warm very quicklyCamera quality isn't very good in low light conditions.The thickness of the phone may put off some people.Will Update if necessary.",0.0,4

I use almost 20 widgets in 3 screens and I hate when phones can't handle this amount of graphic demandHas Micro SD slotHas Android 4.4.4 and it will update to Android 5It looks great. the colors are beautifulThe battery last a huge amount of time, no kiddingThe camera takes pictures so good I don't care forgeting my compact cameraThe margins are thin, so it has a very nice screen size in a good phone size.It has some good add ons from Sony (usually I don't like oem software), like recording the screen (useful when you do a video chat)Cons:It is VERY slippery... if you don't pay attention on where you left it... it may fall to the floor with out noticing.I truly suggest buying this phone.",,4

BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Red,BLU,20.99,5,"I just got this phone and this review is based on my first impressions. This phone gives you a lot for the money. You cannot compare it to the Nokia phones at the same price range. The software/screen/extras are way better. FM radio is a blast! Very clear even without any external headset. In contrast, my new Moto G 2015 does not give you this good reception without a headset. Display is very nice - big, bright, smooth and colorful . Navigation is quite intuitive after 5 minutes playing with the phone. Performance is good. I cannot comment on its call performance since I am only using it with an international sim to receive text messages. The cover is very easy to remove but I found the battery pretty hard to remove. The manual does not indicate how to load the SIM though there is impression embedded near the SIM card compartment. I used a video on YouTube to confirm that I was doing it correctly. Hint - Insert the first sim all the way in until it is flush with the border.

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,2,"This phone started out working beautifully for the last few weeks, (although the punctuation for texting is very inconvenient and lacking). If you get a properly working phone, it seems pretty solid. The camera has bad resolution, so if you are set on a good camera, this is not for you. Overall it has good audio and is solidly built; not sure if the malfunctioning is typical or not. Last night it started acting crazy. When the phone is shut, it keeps activating the ""Voice Command"" function, and shows a microphone icon indicating that it is listening for my voice prompt. Then if there is noise, it sometimes starts randomly calling people based on what it maybe thinks it's hearing. I also think that this prevents it from going into standby mode, therefore it is wasting my battery power. I looked into various Settings menus, but it seems there is no way to shut this function off. Secondly, it has recently started pulling up a ""No Caller ID # Available!"" Alert Message in front of every text message I get, even though I can see the person's name attached message before I try to open it. Furthermore, when I try to hit ""Ok"" to acknowledge the alert, it pops right back up, over and over again, so I can't read my texts. It does this even for old texts. I tried turning it off and taking the battery out, I even tried a factory reset function, and I'm still having the same problems. I also noticed that after I reset it, when it was going through the set up, that the basic ringtones weren't playing at all, even when they said they were, I could hear nothing! And I can't hear a dial tone when I call people. Screwed up! Hopefully it's not a common issue for this phone. It would've been good until this started.",,0

The performance of this phone is great and I have yet to experience any lag whatsoever. The screen is near perfect. The phone is incredibly light. Call quality is great. My previous phone, the Studio X Plus pales in comparison. The power and volume rockers, on the side, are tight and require little push to engage. Battery life is stellar. I get through an entire day with use about 6-7 times per hour, give or take, and I still have 50% left at the end of the day. Why would anyone pay for an expensive phone when phones like this one are just as good? Plus, the speaker quality is great! Youtube just work wonderfully on the device.

Verizon specifically has locked the boot loader so you cannot upgrade the operating system unless you are lucky and they did not update to version 5.0 or something. Don't take the risk! I got this phone so I could run a better operating system and keep it running for years to come at better speeds than the new ones. Looks like that won't be happening. If you do not plan on rooting/jail breaking the phone and getting a new operating system you will not have to worry about this.Also, the chrome plastic rim on this phone chips VERY easily.

BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White,BLU,429.99,5,"Received this yesterday, free one-day shipping on Prime! This is the third Blu phone that I have tried, and it is by far the best one. The others that I tried were unsatisfactory, one mainly because it was a Windows phone, and so it really was the OS that was the problem and not the phone itself, which was a fairly decent piece of budget hardware, and the other because it had a slow processor and 1GB of ram which made it lag like crazy.LIKES:Build: I love the thinness, which is at first rather alarming especially before you put the plastic protective cover on the back. The dibbled surfaces of the cover gives it a better surface for gripping than the smooth glass back. It is VERY light, and you will probably do a double-take when you realize that is the weight of the entire phone and it's not missing a battery! It feels surprisingly solid too.Speed: This is one of the very rare Blu phones that has a decent processor and 2GB of ram, which makes a world of difference from most of the the lower-budget phones that the company makes. I have not experienced any perceptible lag so far.Battery life: Today was my first full day of use for this phone. It was charged overnight and unplugged at 07:30am and at time of writing (10:30pm) it is at 40% battery, and the phone estimates it has 9 hours of juice left. I'd say that's pretty impressive. I made about 5 phone calls, sent plenty of text and whatsapp messages, checked FB and Google search, and played some games for about 20 minutes.DISLIKES: The main downside to this phone is the lack of expandable memory, but I don't fill up my phone with music or photos that much anyway, so it's ok for my needs.Conclusion: I know it's only been one day, but I'm really liking this phone that easy on the pocket in more ways than one!",52.0,4

"ZTE Axon 7 Unlocked Smartphone,64GB Ion Gold (US Warranty)",ZTE,349.98,4,"In the box:- a slim clear case- a screen protector already on the phone as well as an additional for a back up- charger as well as a small overlay piece to use on other chargers to make it usable for this phone (something I did not know was that the charger port going directly into the phone is different from other flagship phones such as samsung galaxies [tldr charger is specific to this phone/brand])Phone charges quickly, plays music and video beautifully, no glitches or bugs thus far (very fast). Initial start up/boot was very slow but after use start up has become quicker. It is more than enough storage for me but does also have the option to add more or input a 2nd sim. Allows control over which sim you're using (can also use both) and which you incur data from, very neat. Upon initial camera use I was not satisfied due to having to adjust the settings manually (I am not a photographer and don't have much experience in this). After messing around with it a bit it does have pretty great picture quality. The fingerprint reader has not failed me once, successful on each attempt and I have 4 fingers uploaded (few days use, as well as purposefully shutting on/off to test this).Some things that have me iffy about keeping the phone (and I'm hoping someone reads this and can offer some input). Any white screens, such as the stock messaging app or going into settings, comes off very fuzzy for me. I'm still able to read the text and it's for the most part clear and crisp, it just looks fuzzy or more so like there is dust under the screen. When there are colours it is not so noticeable thus making it tolerable, but even for a phone costing 400 I expect the screen to be crisp and vibrant in all colours/hues, which this does not seem to be in a white themed setting.4/5 rating - top notch phone other than the fuz in white screens.",11.0,0

Samsung Galaxy S Duos II S7582 DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked International Version - Black,Samsung,299.99,1,"I would like to alert shoppers using Amazon that some of these Samsung Galaxy S DUOS II phones that are advertised for international use could very well be clones/knock offs of Samsung products. Earlier this year I purchased one of these phones through a seller that sells products via Amazon. Upon delivery, I immediately noticed that the phone charger that was shipped with the phone did not mate up correctly to the phone so I needed to use a charger that I used on an old Blackberry instead. Also, I noted that the picture quality of the camera was pretty low grade which surprised me since Samsung generally has good camera quality. After longer use, other strange things like my contact list would appear complete some days and then other days would be missing most of my contacts. Eventually every call that I was receiving would have the phone number of the caller but the name of the caller would be using only Chinese characters (I am using the phone in the US.)The other day, I ended up going to a T-Mobile store in my city and showed them the phone and the weirdness I was seeing since I was using one of their SIM cards and they looked a the phone in detail. It turns that they noticed that the case style was slightly different from a standard Samsung build and that the file structure of the Android OS was missing key operating files that appear on Samsung phones. The Blue Tooth was not functioning either. They came to the conclusion that the phone was a clone/counterfeit product considering all the tell tale signs noted above. They noted that Samsung products are commonly counterfeited and not only just this model. I confirmed this with my own research.The only good thing that I can say about this cloned Samsung Galaxy S DUOS phone is that at bare minimum the Wi-Fi function worked and I could insert a SIM card from a country I visited in SE Asia and was able to at least make a phone call on that phone network. Otherwise, for the price I paid for this phone, and the problems that I managed to discover, I basically got snookered. There may be some legitimate sellers that are selling legitimate Samsung Galaxy S Duos II phones but considering the age of this model, there are likely fewer phones in the S2 or older line up that are legitimate/unmodified.I am not sure I am allowed to list the name of the seller of this phone, but if someone from Amazon can follow up with me, I would be happy to provide the name of the seller and send the phone back to Amazon for their counterfeit product investigations organization to study. Based on my experience with this phone, I would be very cautious about buying a phone on Amazon unless it was through a main line vendor with a good reputation. Sometimes that is hard to determine, so be careful everyone.",3.0,3

Samsung i897 Captivate Android Smartphone Galaxy S GSM Unlocked - Black,,87.99,2,"Bought this Captivate from Cell Lounge. It is a great phone and the screen is fabulous compared to my old Nokia.

The useful life of a typical Li-ion battery is from two to three years max from the date it is manufactured. Although it charges and the phone works, I will be lucky if it lasts over a year.

"Samsung Galaxy S4 I337 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone, Arctic Blue w/ 13MP Camera",,119.95,2,"In my opinion, this might be one of the worst purchases that I have ever made. Not only does it anger me because of the amount of money that I spent as it was a brand new phone, but it also angers & saddens me that I had to research online all the different problems that I continue to have to see how many others have/are experiencing the exact same...No one should have to ever do research like this after spending the amount of money that they do just to find out that they were basically duped, Samsung should be abundantly clear and more than willing to fix any and all manufacturing problems whether the phone is bought directly from them or through a third party carrier---After all, their name is on the phone! Yes, the phone itself works and using it outside of the problems is what I hoped for. However, when you talk on it for even just a few short moments -or- watch any type of a video feed, it quickly gets warm/hot. Next was the battery that has come with it. After pulling it off the charger at 100% (And I am electronic savvy, I have done all the little tricks to keep the battery life from draining so quickly! ), within an hour or so of NO use, the battery life is around 79% - 82%. I have had to recently order and pay out of pocket for $42 an extended life battery, which means that the $35-$40 I spent on my otter box is wasted as I won't be able to use it with my new battery. Finally comes the sim card issue. About once every 1 1/2 days, I get a message on my phone that says ""Unable to detect sim card"" ---Which means that I have to take the entire phone apart, pull out the battery, push the sim card in just a hair as it is only barely out, put the phone back together, and power it on so that I can use it. All these issues with a brand new phone!!!!! I really wish that I had of spent my $400 and some change on an Apple IPhone instead. I will NEVER buy another phone from Samsung, nor will I recommend them to anyone. Samsung may be a giant in the market with plenty of money to toss around, but I work two jobs just to have a nice life and that money is a lot to me!",2.0,0

"HTC DROID INCREDIBLE 2 Android Phone, Black (Verizon Wireless)",HTC,83.98,5,"If you are reading this review, it is 2015 or later. This is not a new phone. You are looking to buy this phone because it is really cheap for what you are getting - a working Android device with a decent camera and no obvious design flaws. It is certainly that. Apples to apples, used, this beats an iPhone 4 any day - and those are running for %50 more than these. (I picked this up for $65 while an iPhone 4 in similar condition was $115.)But, for the love of god, if you are even the slightest bit technologically literate - root your phone and install a new ROM. A lot of these Amazon reviews are complaining about the software, how there are a bunch of bundled Verizon apps (NFL??) that you can't uninstall and that are constantly running - yeah, it's really annoying. Also, the HTC Sense UI is waaay outdated. It was already sketchy in 2012, now it looks like absolute garbage. But guess what? You aren't stuck with it. You don't need to worry about rooting voiding your warranty because that expired 2 years ago. I have Cyanogenmod installed and life is 100% better than the stock ROM. No bloatware, just simplicity and full customization. On the stock ROM, I had to charge the battery every night just from daily use (texting and the occasional website - nothing heavy). Now I last 3-4 days on a single charge.A couple negative notes. The product description claims ""16GB SD card preinstalled"". Don't expect this if you buy used. The sellers don't mention this in the product description but expect to drop an extra $15 on a new SD card to get this phone functional (you can't do much without one, no pictures or anything). Also, Verizon requires a data plan on all smartphones - I bought this phone expecting to be able to use my existing dumb-phone plan with it, but that is just not how things work apparently - had to upgrade to a data plan to activate the phone! I am not happy about that.Still, highly recommended. This is still a quality device even three years after release.",2.0,4

The great part about it is, it is a top quality, flagship phone, from a reputable seller at a great price and comes without the worry of wondering if youll get a clone or refurbished phone or opened box like all the other unlocked phone sellers seem to do. Amazon can be a tad bit of a scary place to buy an unlocked phone. Many don't come with a warranty, are asian versions or are just plain scams as can be seen from the reviews of Galaxy 6s and Notes and other top brands. Not this phone, it is the real deal. I have purchased 3 unlocked phones on Amazon over the last few years since we lived overseas and wanted phones to use internationally with SIMs from different countries. Two of the 3 were problematic and likely clones with major functional flaws. Since this is supplied by Amazon there is the assurance it is an original piece of equipment or easily returnable if not.You get what you pay for and a ton more like the best camera available on a phone and the best sound quality both with and without head phones. The volume and sound on this phone is amazing and by far the loudest and best I have experienced on such a small device.Another bonus is the setup....I was expecting it to take the better part of a day to get contacts and apps installed but with Google backup and NFC it was done in a snap.If there is one drawback it would be that the storage is not expandable with external cards. Also the non replaceable battery is disliked by many but not an issue to me yet since this phone has great battery life. One interesting note is the blue phone is actually black...I thought I got sent the wrong phone but black is not even an option. So don't expect a pretty blue phone, it is more of a matte black.So, go ahead and save yourself a heap of money and get yourself this phone which comes in two days, is returnable, warrantied and one of the best phones of 2015. I highly expect you will be as satisfied as I am.",2.0,4

Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Phone with Dual-Band GSM 850/1900--International Version with No Warranty (Black),Motorola,63.28,4,"This is a very slim cheap phone with a fixed LCD display. It cannot display photos. Text is very large so text message will require alot of scrolling.I bought this to replace a stolen motorola RAZR which I very much liked. I needed a cheap one until I could determine if I wanted an iphone or google phone.Note there is a tone every minute during a call so you know how long your call is. If you are on a plan with very limited minutes, this can be handy. Otherwise you will want to google around to find the code to shut that off.You will also want to find the documentation on how to lock the keypad. Otherwise keys will be pressed which will turn on the backlight and use up the battery while it is in your pocket.The connector for the charger is proprietary, not the handy mini-USB that we've all grown to love.Summary: if you need cheap with no contract, this will do just fine.

At some point the phone's screen showed a red X over an empty battery which usually indicates a defective battery. The battery i received with the phone was all scratched up and clearly used.

Galaxy S5 G900A Factory Unlocked Android Smartphone 16GB White,Samsung,222.0,4,"I am super happy that I got the Samsung S5.

The system provides various special features, e.g. video stabilization, burst shots, face detection, and then the usual, white balance, ISO, exposure value. The front facing camera is useful, good enough to skype.The processor is fast, turning it on and off takes about 30 seconds. I downloaded ~25 apps, and it runs fine.The speakers are not very loud, not enough for me to sing along during a shower.The charging portal is not a conventional one, which is unpleasant because I need to buy several more. And if I forget one when I am away from home, my friends won't have extras.The battery life is pretty low, maybe 1 percentage decrease per 1.5 minutes. If I am watching something 3 hours straight, it would be dead. Overnight, it goes down about 12 % just on standby. The battery is a regular Samsung battery.I am on an AT&T plan, and the phone adjusted smoothly. I had to go to the store to exchange for a smaller SIM card, which took about 30 minutes. The only bump was when my data didn't work due to an old APN. So, I added a new one for ATT and it works fine now.Overall, I am super pleased.",2.0,4

If you want to make sure to get us version you'll have to go with $399 on google which is a lot for this phone. The 2GB RAM works for me fine, but I wouldn't pay $399 for it, considering that most phones in price range of >$399,$400 are with 3GB RAM. I would complain to amazon, but I discovered the india issue few hours ago(after all the customizing etc) hence why I'm posting a review otherwise I would have probably waited for months or maybe never.Live and learn, people.p.s. H791 DOES work with T-mobile, and it DOES support 3G/4G LTE (not sure about the new bands, 12,14 etc)to see if you have h791 or h790 (sadly nowhere on box did it say it, but in small piece on the carton with the sim extraction, which somehow I missed for two days) check the back of the carton where the sim extraction pin thingy comes in, or go to about phone and tap regulatory details and you'll see whether you got the wrong warranty or the whole thing, although unexpected earbuds should be a dead giveaway",1.0,0

"Unlocked Samsung S5570 Galaxy Mini Touchscreen, Wi-Fi, 3G, Android International Smart Phone in Chic White",Samsung,74.99,4,"I have a Verizon Samsung Droid CDMA cellphone, which is now my major phone line I use while home in the USA. I do, however, spend a couple of months a year in France, and while there have a GSM Simcard from the French cell provider SFR, which I have had for several years and which I got from callineurope.com. In addition, I have a T-Mobile prepaid SimCard, which I've used in an old candybar style ""stupidphone,"" which costs me around $90 with online discounts to recharge with 1000 prepaid USA minutes, usable within a year. I have not decided long term what I will do with this T-Mobile service, however inertia is a huge force and for the moment I'm keeping it, and will decide in a few months if I want to ""invest"" another ~$90 to keep the line active for another year. One plus about the annual $100 ($90 with online coupons available sporadically) T-Mobile prepaid recharge, is that as long as you recharge before the expiration period of the last year, you get to keep your unused minutes/cash balance and roll it into the new year along with the new $100/1000 minutes you just recharged with. For an occasional cellphone voice user, this does offer a lot of bang for the buck, especially for emergency or other occasional type usage. You can change your T-Mobile plan over the internet in 1 minute by logging into mytmobile.com which allows you to change from $0.10/minute to a daily rate of $2 (only on days you actually use it) with unlimited talk and unlimited ""2G/2.5G"" Edge level data service. So, if you were going to use this phone for T-Mobile voice and data on a sporadic basis, say 50 days per year while on the road, leaving it turned off the rest of the time, that would be a hard deal to beat, e.g. yearly unlimited voice and data for <$100/year if you don't need the service all the time. And you can change back to the $0.10/minute voice and text only plan when you want to on the T-mobile website.Having become somewhat addicted to the functionality of my Verizon Samsung Droid Charge cell, I decided to replace the old GSM stupidphone I've been using with this small inexpensive Samsung GSM S5570 smartphone. I figured that at the least I could use web browsing and other features that require a network on WiFi networks as I encounter them, which would at least give me an updated Google contact list plus my appointments calendar. As far as using this phone on data networks, there are a couple of caveats I have discovered and which I detail below.I am not going to comment on the limitations of this phone that have already been discussed ad nauseum in online reviews, such as the small, low-resolution touch screen, battery life, etc. At $140 unlocked as I type this, you are not going to get the features of a high end cellphone for this price. For the record, my phone came from the Amazon seller ""Global Mobiles,"" apparently a German company whose orders are fulfilled by Amazon. It came with all advertised accessories including the charger (European plug but with USA adapter), a fresh and recently manufactured battery, manuals in German, and a near useless 2gb micro SD card. The phone was set up to function in English when I got it, and showed zero evidence of ever having been opened or touched by human hands after it was manufactured.Limitations on data network usage that I have discovered so far include:(1) Only up to ""3G speeds,"" not ""4G"" -- There is considerable confusion as regards what is 3G, what is 4G, and how they compare. The executive summary is that although there are going to be differences in speed within an individual carrier's offerings of 3G vs. 4G, you cannot compare among the various carriers because the carriers define ""4G"" and ""3G"" differently and they also use different transmission bands and technologies. There are going to be carriers who have faster ""4G"" offerings that cannot be effectively utilized with this phone that claims ""3G"" service but not ""4G"" service. Research your own carrier and what level of service you expect to get from it, before buying this phone. That could probably be said of most any cellphone out there.(2) US T-Mobile has what they call ""4G"" service and ""3G"" service, which use bands that this phone DOES NOT HAVE. You will be able to use this phone with T-Mobile ""EDGE"" service, which is variously labeled as ""2G"" by some and elevated to ""2.5G"" by some others, which is to say it has the potential to be faster than your typical, dial-up slow 2G service, however it will still seem very slow compared to a good home broadband connection or to any decent 3G or 4G service. From some web research that I did after buying this phone, it is obvious that there are only a limited number of GSM cellphones out there that can utilize T-Mobile's fastest data network(s); most of these phones are going to be sold directly by T-Mobile, and few will be available as unlocked phones sold on Amazon or that well known online auction site. Your best option if you want fast, T-Mobile USA data service would be to get your phone directly from T-Mobile and then perhaps find a way to unlock it if you want to then use it on another network as well.For use in Europe, this phone should provide reasonably fast, ""3G"" level data services, however the cost of such data service is very high if you don't have the sort of year round data plan that most travelers will not have. As such, if you have a pay as you go or prepaid plan from a European carrier or reseller from a carrier, you will probably elect to use available WiFi networks for most of your data use on this phone, with perhaps email usage through the carrier's data service. For that purpose, the phone should work well and offer a lot more functionality than an old style ""stupidphone.""For my own uses, basically as a travel voice cellphone with some smartphone features, most of which I will access through hotel and other free hotspot WiFi networks, with occasional cell carrier data usage for email, this phone is a good choice at an attractive price. I would not want to use this phone as my everyday smartphone, but for periodic or vacation use outside of my usual carrier's network, it is certainly a more enjoyable phone to use than an old style stupidphone.",3.0,4

"POSH MOBILE MICRO X, The Smallest Smartphone in the World, ANDROID UNLOCKED 2.4"" GSM SMARTPHONE with 2MP Camera and 4GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (MODEL#: S240 PINK)",Posh Mobile,49.91,3,"Worked really well for a few months. Now the sound only works if it is on speaker phone. At this point I only really use it to access the internet and messenger. For this function it is good. For phone calls and skype it is nearly worthless. Especially skype or any app like snap chat it loads too slow. All videos are very pixalated. Even when I send them. Camera is also pretty crappy compared to other phones I have had. (Nexus 5, Samsung Galaxy3) Now that the memory is almost already full (in only 6 monthes) I have to restart it A LOT, apps crash a lot/ freeze and the camera has problems. I only purchased because I am living out of the country and wanted a cheap phone that I don't have to insure. For that purpose I believe it has met my expectations. Also can hold two sim cards which is very nice as I travel back and forth and need to switch carriers. Compared to cost of other phones that i have had before and comparing it's processing to it is good value. 1/5th of the price!!!! The appearance is very nice. Even the guy in the cell phone store thought it was an iphone 6. Also very durable and comes with a screen protector and case which is convenient and saves money. Battery life is good. I charge every night even though it never gets below 50% (unless I'm using constantly all day), also charges fairly fast.Don't get it you are expecting it to act like a $400 phone. I think it would be a GREAT fit for 1st time smart phone owners.",0.0,2

CNPGD [U.S. Office Extended Warranty] Smartwatch Watch Cell Phone Water Resistant NFC Heart Rate Monitor Dual OS Available for Android and IOS Gold,CNPGD,59.99,4,"It works as described, although, print is so tiny, texting is near impossible without a magnifying glass, unless you have 20/20 vision. Every time you want to write a text message you must scroll thru like 10-15 input modes to get to English ABC, it won't keep your setting. For me, input with keypad is easiest. Handwriting mode is frustating, because you must write each letter so it understands it correctly, and for me it's rare that it does. You must enter the number text is going to, manually , unless you are replying to an incoming message. There is no recent or other menu, so if you do not know the number by heart, write it down before you start to text. Making and taking calls is easy. Bluetooth is best, due to speaker volume and position on watch. It's akin to trying to put your elbow in your ear. It does have voice dialing. It gets the person I'm trying to dial correct maybe 10% of the time. Again, it may just be me it is having trouble understanding. I have no accent, born and raised in SF Bay area. I must install sim card every time I use it, as I only have 1. each time i do, it has the correct date, but never the right time. Setting the time is a pain too. I just make a mental note of how far off it is and calculate approx time. It works fine for what I got it to do... place/receive calls/texts without holding a phone, while I shop!!

I am using Cricket wireless with it and it's working great. No issues with the 4G LTE/4G data connections. It's quick, responsive, and has a nice feel to it. Only gripe I have is that removing the back cover is near impossible for me for some reason and I am afraid to continue to try to remove it for fear that I'll scratch it (although I think the people at Cricket may have scratched it already to install the sim card).

So I returned the Moto G for this phone. It really is a nice phone. Intuitive. Moto G lets you call your contacts and that's it.

Simple annoying things like that-- stuff you don't really think about til you see the difference--brought me to this phone.HOWEVER, the phone I got was not totally new.

"ZTE Z431 Unlocked GSM Phone with 2.4"" Display, 2MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, GPS, SNS Integration, Muisic Player and microSD Slot - Black",ZTE,21.8,5,"It has a sleek design which feels like a Blackberry. The display is very sharp.For a featured (non -smart) phone, you can not beat the price for this quality. So my rating is having the price in mind.It consumes very little power on standby. It can last as long as six days without charging.This phone is not very fast, but better than other AT&T phones I had. The camera is so so but I don't use that function much anyway.It has a microSD slot which can go very large in storage. It is better for music than photos. I tried the image function. It certainly stores the photos you take from the phone. But if you load other large size photos into the SD card, the phone does not have enough power to display a large size photograph. So it you want to use this device to carry photos you took elsewhere, you have down size them first before loading into the SDcard. But consider other feature phones which do not even display any photos, this is a good function.In addition to the QWERTY keyboard, the has the T9 input function, a smart fast typing capability, good for composing long text content.My only gripe is that it has built in English and Spanish input options, but no other language (e.g. Chinese) input options. It displays Chinese (incoming text) well. If there is a way to update the firmware for Chinese input, it will be great.",1.0,4

PRIV by BlackBerry Factory Unlocked Smartphone - Black (U.S. Warranty),BlackBerry,349.98,5,"I am biased: I love BlackBerry phones. I owned the Bold and the Curve back in the early days of smartphones, then I got all caught up in the iPhone craze. I came back to BlackBerry when, to my surprise, I discovered they were still in business and making great phones. I ditched the iPhone, got a Q10 and then a Passport. I love, love, love BB10, the current OS. But, like a lot of people, I really missed some of the apps I used on the iPhone. Of course, BB10 can run some Android apps, just not all of them and some of them run poorly. Then I found the Priv. It's an odd but swanky phone that people notice and you'll enjoy using in public.First, let me say that it's a near-top-of-the-line Android phone, so if you like Android, you'll love the Priv. BlackBerry has tweaked the OS slightly and that tweaking seems to have improved the over all security of the phone. It comes with the Google Play store preloaded and that is the ONLY place to get your apps, unless you want to download APKPure, another great source for Android apps. Your BlackBerry apps are not available for the Priv. This is a BlackBerry phone in name only.Second, this thing is fast! I mean blazing fast. I used the Galaxy Note (not sure which version) to compare, and the Priv compares favorably, though the screen was slightly smaller. Speaking of the screen, it's a huge selling point. Streaming videos (Netflix or ones locally stored) look awesome.Third, the rear facing camera is slightly better than average. The front facing camera is not the greatest. So if you are a compulsive, narcissistic selfie addict, you'll be underwhelmed. The onboard photography suit is pretty decent, though.Fourth, the keyboards. Yes, plural. The slide-out physical keyboard is good, although the keys seem small to me. Mind you, I was used to the awesome Passport with it's large keys, so my judgment might be a bit subjective. Typing using the physical keyboard was a bit of a chore, and eventually I found myself slapping it shut so I could use the virtual keyboard, which is outstanding, I have to say. BlackBerry has scored with its virtual keyboard; it's far, far superior to the iPhone keyboard.Lastly, I give this phone 5 stars because it is a good piece of technology. People get all caught up in buying a ""name,"" like Samsung or iPhone, but the BlackBerry Priv holds its own in a world awash with good quality phones. One final point, the build quality is unsurpassed. This thing is tough; a lot tougher than it feels, which is to me, its only downside - how it feels in the hand. Maybe it's the slider mechanism, but this phone doesn't feel as ""solid"" as the Passport or the Q10. But it is, I assure you. I've dropped it a couple of times and you'd never know it.In the end, I still prefer the BB10 OS to the Android OS; it's smoother, prettier, and more intuitive. My Passport remains by favorite, go-to phone. But there's no denying that the Priv is a top notch smartphone that is hard to beat and fun to use. It was way overpriced when it first came out, but the price has really come down in recent months, making the Priv a wise choice.",13.0,3

He owns several thousand head of cattle and spends all day jumping up and down from a pickup into a cattle pen. He drops his phones on concrete and into cattle pens. He doesn't need a lot of fancy features on the phone, just durability and the ability to run a few apps. I suggested the Moto E because of the Gorilla Glass. After 4 months, he was happy, calling it the ""best phone he's had since the original RAZR"". He liked it enough to buy 3 more for his hired hands.You can't compare this with the Moto X as it's a lower spec phone.

It is at least as beautiful in design and execution as the HTC one M8 or M9 and also is comparable to the Iphone 6 plus in design quality.

It is actually slightly shorter in length and about 3/16"" wider and a few mm thicker, and though it's all metal and glass it is not as slippery in the hand as the Iphone. The finger print sensor works quite well, and the cameras are amazing. It works with T-mobile LTE and has great signal strength both for cellular network and for wifi.

Initially I was shocked to see all features (that you find only in Samsung, iPhone) for just $299. I scrutinized the technical details and got myself convinced. Then I took a risk and ordered this phone. Initially I was happy but little unhappy because it appeared to have very ordinary UI and it got heated in first ten minutes. However as I began filling the UI with different apps, it started looking amazing. The display is fantastic. The speed is great. Very smooth phone. The camera is ordinary and long distance shots are not sharp but that's ok. All other features simply beat few cons in the phone. All in All a great phone at a budget rate. Don't forget to get a flip cover as occassional heating may bother you. I would conclude to say that this is a very nice and sweet big phone.",2.0,4

Before I ordered this phone, I never read anywhere that I would need to by an SD memory card in order to do basically anything that wasn't just calls or texts. The screen doesn't light up when you get a text. The sensor that is supposed to keep the screen turned off when you are talking on the phone isn't very sensitive. There is no task manager, the battery drains fast even if you aren't using it AT ALL. You can't get rid of extra home screens that you aren't using.

Nokia 220 RM-971 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2MP Camera (Black),Nokia,174.1,2,"Darn hard to open the back cover; in fact, I couldn't open it without taking atool to it which would most likely ruin the product. I had to return it for the Nokia X3-02 model, which I already have and the new one would be used for another carrier SIM card. I am providing a review of my limited but informative experience.The 220 is bigger than it looks (I was hoping it would be the size of the Motorola Rockr (a well built phone--couldn't find batteries for it anymore)). It is light and the complete back casing where the phone's face snaps into the rear housing-case is good at eliminating dirt and what-not that tends to get into the back of phones. It feels like a $50 phone; buttons feels a little cheap--not cheap but a little cheap--like $50 cheap. There is no open anywhere else other than for the charger and headphone jacks. Here's the problem this phone posed for me that make it not workable for my purposes: I do not like to ""transfer"" my files on the SD micro card; I like to pop it out of the phone, insert it into a thumb USB drive and plug it into my computer to open (I avoid all the registering, logging in here and there, updates that and this, tracking me here and there, and all the other pain in the butt trailer tagging electronic vendors tie to your every move/use. So access to the SD card is often and since I couldn't even open the back cover off to put the phone's battery it, (if you have joint problems or joint issues this phone is not for you) well, it wouldn't work for me. It looks like a snap on video, but it's a serious impediment in real life, and I'm no weakling--I'm sure I could open it with the beyond normally required force, but I could have snap or break something inside rendering it less desirable. If I have to exert more than normally required, it would not work for me who routinely removes the SD card. For me, regardless of how well it functions, for my purposes, the hard to open back cover was the deal breaker.I already have a Nokia X3-02 and that's a great phone; really thin, super sleek; I don't care what phone you have, when I pull the X3-02 out, I get double looks. I just didn't want to have two of the same, but it looks like that's my only option in the unlock GMS candy-bar style.",5.0,4

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,3,"Positive side:- I ordered the phone on January 21 in the evening. And, I received it in Florida today January 24. The estimated delivery time was between Tuesday, January 28, 2014 and Wednesday, February 12. So, this was a good surprise.- The phone looks OK. I still need to test its proper functioning over a long period. But, all looks fine to me so far.Negative side:- The instructions book cover is in French. However, because I speak and read French, this was of no problem to me.- But, the instructions are in German - no French and no English. And, I don't speak nor write German. I downloaded the instructions from the Web. This German instructions booklet with a French cover is odd. I would like to make sense out of it.- I found no list of the parts included in the package. There may be some parts missing, but I wouldn't know it. An exhaustive list is only standard for any phone.- One of the plastic wraps containing small parts was visibly torn open. There may have been some tampering and some parts missing. How do I know?- I was expecting a 2 GB SD card included as described on the gsmarena dot com website. Their description concerns the US market. There is none. So, It may be missing, but I wouldn't know since there is no list of the included parts. Samsung typically includes a small SD memory. Anyhow, this does not appear to be a phone initially destined for the US region. Features may be lesser.- I didn't find a clear mention of the seller's company whereabouts in the package.- I find no mention of the warranty, and no warranty card as is to be expected with a Samsung phone.- A flyer was included in the package. It mentions: ""Leave a positive feedback within 7 days of delivery to extend your warranty to 45 days"". I don't buy into that. I realize that I was influenced in my choice of vendor by the positive reviews. This may explain that.Conclusion:It's too early to jump to a conclusion. But, I find these unprofessional practices not reassuring. I have doubts as to whether my phone is a legit unlocked new phone and not a refurbished one or a manufacturer's defective series. The instruction manual in German with a French cover is a good indication it is. This should be mentioned in the Amazon product description.",0.0,0

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,2,"This phone started out working beautifully for the last few weeks, (although the punctuation for texting is very inconvenient and lacking). If you get a properly working phone, it seems pretty solid. The camera has bad resolution, so if you are set on a good camera, this is not for you. Overall it has good audio and is solidly built; not sure if the malfunctioning is typical or not. Last night it started acting crazy. When the phone is shut, it keeps activating the ""Voice Command"" function, and shows a microphone icon indicating that it is listening for my voice prompt. Then if there is noise, it sometimes starts randomly calling people based on what it maybe thinks it's hearing. I also think that this prevents it from going into standby mode, therefore it is wasting my battery power. I looked into various Settings menus, but it seems there is no way to shut this function off. Secondly, it has recently started pulling up a ""No Caller ID # Available!"" Alert Message in front of every text message I get, even though I can see the person's name attached message before I try to open it. Furthermore, when I try to hit ""Ok"" to acknowledge the alert, it pops right back up, over and over again, so I can't read my texts. It does this even for old texts. I tried turning it off and taking the battery out, I even tried a factory reset function, and I'm still having the same problems. I also noticed that after I reset it, when it was going through the set up, that the basic ringtones weren't playing at all, even when they said they were, I could hear nothing! And I can't hear a dial tone when I call people. Screwed up! Hopefully it's not a common issue for this phone. It would've been good until this started.",1.0,0

(1 Year Warranty) (International and Domestic use)",Posh Mobile,129.88,4,"Picked up the phone when it was on sale that I couldn't pass up. FYI, I'm a bit of a phone hoarder. Figured what the heck! My daily driver now is an LG G4 and my Google Nexus 6 that I switch between. Now to this Posh offering. I've gotta say that I'm quite impressed for what you can get for less than $150. Both of my phones were $600 at release and this Posh Titan HDe600 can do what these other big boys can do. The processor does not lag and it can handle multiple apps simultaneously. Both of my higher end phones have 3GB of RAM and the Posh only utilizes 1GB, but somehow, it just works really well. Also, video rendering is really great, not just ok. Which leads me into the display. Both of the phones I normally rock have 4K displays. So my expectation of having a display with only a 720p resolution was not high, however, after streaming Netflix, You Tube and HBO GO content, I can confidently tell you the display on this phone is FANTASTIC. It is very comparable to my much higher end phones with supposedly 8 times the resolution. T-Mobile signal is a bit spotty inside of some buildings, but for the most part it is good. Speaker phone is loud enough and clear as is the headset built into the phone. Battery life is pretty good for a screen that is this large. With light to moderate use I can easily get a day and a half until I get to 25-30%. The GPS has been good so far, not an issue as other reviewers have noted. MY ONLY MAJOR GRIPE (and I feel bad complaining about this phone because of how little it cost and how great everything else works) IS THAT THE PHONE DOES NOT USE GORILLA GLASS!!!! OMG!!! The only reason that I've moved back to my G4 is because I really DO NOT LIKE the plastic like texture glass that Posh Mobile decided to use. I understand it was most likely a cost issue, but I cannot stress enough how that one cost cutting area is deal breaker for me. I had no idea that I could deal so well with lower end resolution, RAM, processor specs, internal storage, etc. and be happy with how the phone works. BECAUSE IT DOES! I also had no idea the glass would make SOO much of a difference. Posh, please use better glass on your phones. Otherwise, I love this phone for what you did with it for such a low cost. Please contact me for more feedback. I love what your company is doing with putting out great affordable phones. You are SOOOOOO close. Peace.",0.0,4

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,408.0,1,"I bought this phone as a replacement for my Z1 which I had for over two and half years. I had zero issues with it until I shattered the screen. The Xperia line of phones are touted as being waterproof or at least they were initially. Sony seems to have shied away from that position now and for good reason. You see, I originally bought the Z1 for three main reasons: the 20mp camera, water resistance, build quality. My experience with the Z1 lead me to believe that the Z5c would be a suitable replacement. I assumed that the Z5c would certainly exceed the standards set by the Z1. I was wrong.Firstly, the positives1) The camera of the Z5c does outperform the Z1's especially in low light conditions. The overall picture quality is only slightly better, however.2) The UI is smoother and faster, likely due to the more powerful CPU3) Slightly better battery life4) Twice the storage capacity5) No flap cover for the USB slot6) Louder speakersThe negatives1) Plastic frame. The phone feels cheap compared to the Z1. It also is less damage resistant than the metal Z12) Frosted glass back plate. While it looks nice, it makes the phone slick and therefore harder to hold3) Build quality and water resistanceI assumed that the Z5c would be even more watertight than the Z1 since it has a higher IP certification. Nope. Even though I swam with my Z1 dozens of times, occasionally exceeding its depth rating, I never once had any issues. I would even wash it in the sink weekly. The phone was waterproof until I broke the screen. The Z5c, on the other hand, died the very moment it touched water. It was thoroughly waterlogged as if it lacked a water resistant seal entirely.Sony's repair service only made matters worse. They claimed that my Z5c was made for the Polish market (what?) and that there are no repair centers in the US. I was given an address in England to ship it and they said they would pay for Royal Mail shipping. Naturally, they could not seeing as how there are no Royal Mail offices in the US. Despite paying for shipping, Sony fixed the phone free of charge since it was under warranty. The turn around time was a bit over a month. I believe I got lucky as I have read that Sony will not honor warranty claims that are the result of water damage.So I go to turn the phone on and all seems well. At this point, I'm just glad to finally have my phone back. However, to my dismay the volume key does not work. They replaced the screen along with many internal components and performed a diagnostics test and yet somehow the broken volume key passed the test. What the heck. Every Xperia phone lets you run a simple pass/fail diagnostic test in the settings menu. One of the tests is for the volume rocker key. I don't understand how they missed this.I reached out to Sony again who said to ship the phone to them. And so I did. Over three weeks went by before I asked them for a status update. They told me they did not receive my phone. Strange. USPS stated that it passed customs and marked it as delivered. A couple more weeks go by before I receive an international package at my door. I thought maybe they had fixed my phone without notifying me. A foolish thought. What happened was that the Sony Service Center refused to take possession of the package so it was returned to me. Apparently there was a customs fee that they would not pay, despite stating that they would pay for shipping both ways. Since I paid for shipping to them both times they could have at least paid the measly fee. Why would Sony pays for it the first time but not the second? I asked USPS if I could pay the fee upfront and I was told I cannot.I've had it with Sony. Clearly the quality of their phones isn't what it used to be, not to mention the quality of their customer service. I'll update this review if Sony rectifies the situation. Don't hold your breath though.",1.0,0

"BLU Dash M - 5.0"" Smartphone - US GSM Unlocked - Black",BLU,69.97,1,"I loved the idea of being able to purchase an affordable phone from someone other than a cell phone provider in attempt to get around the ATT scam of the ""Next"" plan which is basically a rent to own program resulting in the customer paying $400-$500 dollars for older out of date phones. So I bought 2 of these phones for my parents, the phones look good and are fairly easy to use. Unfortunately they do not work, many times a day fail to receive either phones calls or text messages. The person calling is immediately directed to voicemail and the person using the phone is completely unaware that someone is trying to contact them. What makes it worse is the person using the phone can call or text fine, so they think the phone is functioning normally. The only way to correct the problem is to reboot the phone. When you reboot the phone you see you missed phone calls and text messages. This issue is happens multiple times per day. We have tried every thing we can to correct the problem including software updates and new sim cards. Both phones are having this issue so I feel pretty confident it is a phone issue.

BLU Studio 7.0 II -Unlocked Smartphone - US GSM - Blue,BLU,95.88,2,"Reason I got this phone: So even though I am very well versed in phones of just about every kind (I own multiple Android phones, Windows Phones, and iPhone 6, a Z10, a Fire Phone, etc), I did not realize that anyone had put out a 7 inch phone. When I noticed it was under $150, I went ahead and made the purchase. I understood that the specs were fairly low and that it wasn't going to blow me away. As long as everything worked as expected, albeit slower than my G Flex 2, I felt this would be a fun phone to use from time to time when I didn't want to carry a tablet and a phone. Did it live up to my ""just work"" expectations?I generally find ""pro"" and ""con"" lists very useful when trying to find specific details so that is how I am going to handle this.Pros:-SIM Card Worked Immediately: I have had MANY phones I had to change APN settings before data would work, including really expensive ones. Studio 7.0 ii had no problems and I didn't have to mess with any settings.-Speaker: Some other reviewers have listed this as a con but I thought it sounded just fine for a cheap phone. It isn't extremely loud nor is extremely clear, but it does it job when listing to podcasts in bed or playing a quick game. If my environment is loud, I use headphones.-Bluetooth And WIFI Worked Great: I used bluetooth headphones and my home WIFI without fail.-Played Games Surprisingly Well: I immediately downloaded Minecraft as a test. While it took awhile to loud, it ran rather smooth. I see this on a lot of newer low end phones. They take awhile to load more demanding games but do surprisingly well once it is complete.-Appearance: It looks like a very nice device. Back mimics the original Nexus 7 but looks more elegant with the metal trim. The front gives off an HTC M7/M8/M9 vibe.-Weight: It felt light in my hands for its overall size. Sure it is my heaviest phone, but it is 7 inches!Cons:-Battery: Simply bad. There really isnât any other way to describe it. With no games, phone calls and minimal video, I canât imagine the Studio 7 ii ever lasting a full day.-USB Port: Most USB ports on phones have a ""click"" when the cord is inserted. Not only doesn't this phone have the same sound or sensation, but different cords have all fallen out of this phone with very minimal pull. It became hard to use and charge at the same time.-Screen Sensitivity: Too many times did I have to touch the screen twice before it registered what I was trying to do.-No Proximity Sensor: So this partly my fault for not noticing the omission prior to purchase. I didnât realize how much I would miss it until my face started an internet radio station while talking on the phone. This really should be on EVERY phone.-Video Streaming Issues: In multiple apps, I had issues streaming video. During the first minute, I would get an error message. Once the video restarted, I would have no problems. This happened consistently.-Minimal Screen Brightness Adjustments: As someone who uses their phone in bed quite a bit, I often change brightness levels. Difference between the highest and lowest settings in laughable at best.-Sim Card/SD Card Slot: Using a screw might sound like a good idea considering everyone owns screwdrivers. Big problem? The screw is so tiny that it becomes incredibly easy to misplace it. As someone who changes phones all the time, I am worried it will drop in the couch or something like that. They should have just used a typical slot.-Microphone During Call: I have made exactly one phone call so far with this phone, and I made it expressly to test how using a 7in phone would work out. Straight from the beginning, the person on the other side had troubles hearing me. I had to press the phone against my face for the sound to be loud enough on the other end.-Camera: I hate to list this as a con since I knew neither would be good, but they terrible. They are probably worse than the $50 Windows Phones I have used in the last couple years. Grainy is the norm and unfortunately it stands out more on the low-res screen.-SD Card Support: Honestly this could just be my unit, but my card became corrupt within one day of putting it into this phone. The card has been fine in multiple other devices so I know it isn't the card.-Power Button Response: If I haven't touched my phone in 20 minutes or more, the screen won't come on for a SOLID 5 seconds. Obviously this is unacceptable, even for a phone in this price range.-Android Not Up To Date: I do not give any phone maker wiggle room on this. I am a firm believer that EVERY phone should get updates for 2 years from original release date. Considering this device hasn't been updated since release (as far as I can tell), Blu needs to get their act together. Stagefright exploit needs to be patched.Neutral:-Screen: It is exactly what I thought it would be: a low resolution 7 inch screen that does the job.-General Speed: Going in-between apps isnât speedy but certainly is good enough, esp. for those used to lower end devices.-USB Port Location: I much prefer it on the bottom but understand that this is different for everyone.So here is the real question: Do I plan on keeping this phone and would I recommend it to anyone? Simply no. My experience with talking on the phone made me quickly realize this is simply a tablet with a single, low end mic at the bottom of the device. Blu didnât put any thought into making the usability of such a large device easier for the user. Given the phone issues, USB port issues and the SD card issues, I couldnât possibly suggest anyone buy this. It makes a below average tablet and an horrible phone.",13.0,0

Also takes more than good pictures and 1080i video. I think it is a real value, it's all plastic, most are, but feels solid and heavy. Screen is bright, I downloaded Music Player + and my music sounds just great, like I never heard it before, either is the app or great electronics in this phone.

I purchased a new unit instead of a used or refurbished unit based on other reviewers having problems with their purchases of those types of units. This new unit comes with the Android 4.1.2 operating system, a must if you are planning on rooting your phone. I have used all the major functions and have had no issues. Since I already had one of the Samsung Galaxy S3 units prior to ordering this one, I knew what to look/test for. I think the MOST important thing to know when ordering a replacement cell phone is who the seller is. Check the seller reviews and the product reviews. I notice that many folks did not mention who they had purchased a phone from - when I compared the poor reviews to the reviews the customers gave the seller(s) it became easy to see who was selling a quality product.Last but certainly not least, I purchased the S3 because the S5 is like holding a dinner plate to your face.

"Sony Xperia XA Ultra unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",Sony,329.99,1,"The phone itself is great but the software contains a bug that drains the battery fast even while it's asleep. Apparently the bug causes the phone not to enter sleep properly and also a bug dealing with WiFi scanning. Sony is suppose to provide a fix at some point. I like the phone so much that I would like to deal with it until the update but the bug is so bad that I don't think that's possible. For example, my phone had around 55-65% left and after 8 hours of absolutely no use, the battery was completely dead. Even using temporary fixes people provide online couldn't alleviate the problem for me. I'm disappointed that I am going to have to return and look for something else because it has a great screen, takes fabulous pictures, speaker is loud but sounds a little ""tin-y"" and seems to be the perfect size I'm looking for in a phablet. The white option for this phone makes it look sick as well. The only things I would change is have the volume rocker more towards the top of the phone on the side instead of in the middle on the side, move the on/off button to the top of the phone. Moving these would make it easier to use and would make finding a car mount easier. Have a user replaceable battery, and have the phone charge faster (they advertise that it's a fast charge, but coming from a Samsung note 4, it's far from a fast charge. Might have to buy a different charger to accomplish that). And fix the battery drain bug asap.UPDATE: If anyone has purchased this phone and is dealing with the battery drain issue, I have been able to decrease the battery drain by installing the app: 360 Battery Plus and also turning off WiFi scanner in the settings menu. This seems to have made the issue more tolerable if you decide to keep the phone until Sony fixes it. Hope this helps you like it did for me.",14.0,4
"Nokia C6 Unlocked GSM Phone with Easy E-mail Setup, Side-Sliding Touchscreen, QWERTY, 5 MP Camera, and Free Ovi Maps Navigation (White)",Nokia,99.95,1,"This phone looked great online, but after only 3 days I can't wait to return it. If this phone is Nokia's answer to the I-Phone they have a long way to go! First of all it will not stay connected to WiFi. The phone constantly loses the WiFi connection and I have to manually select to connect back to it only to lose the connection again a few minutes later. I don't know if this particular phone is defective or if that's how they all are, but my computer and I-Touch stay connected to WiFi just fine so I know its not my network. Well I figured no big deal because I have a data plan (that my Blackberry worked fine on) but even this is slow. Retreiving emails and using Facebook is so painfully slow that it's pretty much unusable. The interface is also slow and the phone constanly freezes.

GreatCall Jitterbug5 Easy-to-Use Cell Phone and Medical Alert Device for Seniors - Red,Jitterbug,99.9,1,"There is a lot to like about the phone itself: with its large numbers on the screen and big buttons it should be very senior-friendly. But my complaint, and the reason I returned the phone, is with Great Call, the outfit through which phone service is provided. It's unfortunate there are no alternative service providers for this phone.First of all, I never got the phone activated. Entering the serial number on the Great Call web site kept producing a message that the serial number was invalid. After calling Great Call, the first person I spoke to agreed that the serial number was invalid. The serial number was on both a card included with the phone, and on the box the phone came in, and they matched. He kept asking me where I got the phone, apparently trying to get me to admit that I bought it used or stolen, out of someone's trunk instead of off Amazon. Eventually that first person transferred me to the ""Activation Department"".The Activation Department guy was sure we would be able to activate the phone, but he needed a credit card before he could even try. And he said the process would take about 25 minutes! I'm sorry, but I've activated enough software and hardware in my day to know there's no reason I shouldn't be able to do so through their web site. And if I absolutely have to talk to a person about it, there's no way it should take 25 minutes. I told him if that's a sample of how ""user-friendly"" the Jitterbug was going to be, there's no way my 86-year-old relative would be able to use it. And I returned the phone.",5.0,0

Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - US GSM Unlocked Phone,Motorola,89.99,4,"Purchased in early July. This has been a decent temporary phone for my broken S3. I plan on upgrading to a high end phone when one is released that peaks my interest.Update Sept 22nd:Speaker works again!? My hunch is that there was a software bug and Motorola pushed a background software update. You've earned your star back!Time and again though I'm reminded of my camera woes. The distant scenery shots are good, but anything that's about 1-2 ft or closer are fuzzy. Things such as bar codes and QR codes are not readable by my phone since it can't make a sharp image. Hopefully it's just mine, but I have no one to compare. I'll post some pictures as some point.Update, Sept 1st:Speaker no longer works. It was fine a few days ago, I didn't do anything potentially destructive to the phone (no drops, no liquids, etc). It's just been in my pocket or on the table. This likely is a manufacturing defect on the Moto E since it was an issue for the Moto G. The issues are just now starting to appear. You've been warned.Prior to Sept 1st:Overall, it does all the basics that I require and is still quite responsive. Screen looks fine. It's slightly thick while still feeling solid and quality given it's inexpensive price point. Being the basic Android with Google sync works great for me. No extra apps required to keep things moving.Downsides: Camera is garbage! 1-2 ft photos are horribly fuzzy while distant photos the edges are soft. For example, if I took a picture of a tree, it will be difficult to clearly distinguish the edges of the leaves.The lack of 4G compared to my S3 is more noticeable than I thought. It still is okay, but I must not be in a rush to find something. The wireless seems to be spotty at times, which didn't happen with my S3. Wifi speeds are the way to go and what I use most frequently anyways.",1.0,0

Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl Zeiss Optics Camera - Yellow,Nokia,99.99,1,"I've been a long-time Windows Phone user, and I absolutely love both, Nokia phones and the Windows Phone OS. I've used a Lumia 920 in the past, so I know it's a solid phone. So the 1 star rating is for the state the phone came in, and NOT for Lumia 920.Pros:- The phone is unlocked, as advertised.- There is no carrier branding on the phone chassis.Cons:- The phone came poorly packaged. It was in an opened box, and had clearly been used before.- When I turned the phone on, it did not take me through the Windows Phone ""out of box experience"", where I get to pick the language, settings, etc. Instead, I was taken directly to the start screen. For a phone that's being sold as new, this is NOT acceptable.- The device came from Mexico and has a Movistar carrier branding in the software - splash screen (which cannot be changed), ring tones, background, etc. The fact that I couldn't get rid of the original carrier branding in the software was a huge downer.- The phone is capped to 4G. I know that the Lumia 920 supports LTE, but when I went into the system settings, the ""Highest connection speed"" option only lists 2G, 3G, and 4G. So this must be a cap introduced by the original carrier. Either this must be clearly advertised on the product's page as a limitation, or it must support everything the Lumia 920 is designed to support. Again, unacceptable.- By default, the keyboard and language are set to Spanish, but these could be changed easily, so it wasn't a big concern to me.I bought this phone as a gift, but there were far too many reasons to return this phone, so that's exactly what I did. I'm hugely disappointed in Amazon for allowing such sellers to sell their products here.",4.0,0

I find the size appropriate and easy to handle even though it is smaller than my previous Nexus 4.The reason I give it only 1 star is because a huge overlook the phone designers did with this model. Eventhough Android allows to install apps on the memory card, this phone doesn't support that feature even if you define the card as your primary storage.I researched forums and confirmed there is no limitations from Android, I also wrote to support from CAT and they said Android didn't allow to move apps to the memory card and that only in Lolly Pop Google is considering allowing it.To make things even worse, the Amazon listing indicated the phone has 4GB, the set I received only has 2 GB.So if your are looking for a tough phone and do not have/use many apps, this is the phone for you.

Samsung Galaxy Note I717 16GB 4G LTE GSM Android Phone - Carbon Blue (AT&T version),Samsung,119.5,1,"I ordered this phone through Tablet Distributors. I got the phone on October 7 2013. Upon opening the phone, I noticed that the phone came without the stylus. how upsetting. the phone was sealed, but upon opening the device, the phone looked dirty and tampered with. I contacted Amazon and the told me that they will refund part of my money because the phone did not come with a stylus pen. However, upon starting the device and accessing its features, I noticed that the phone began flashing, making various unnecessary colors without any commands. I also noticed that the battery which was at 50% when opened, went down to 19% within 5 mins of use ( iam not exaggerating). In that case, I told Amazon that I am sending the phone back, but since its from a ""fulfilled vendor"" ( in this case, an unfulfilled vendor) ""Tablet Distributors,"" I was told that I wasn't able to receive a replacement. I sent it back for a refund.These third party vendors should stop overcharging the customer for the phone, knowing fully well that some accessories have been removed or the item has been tampered with. They should stop branding tampered phones as new which is misleading to the customer. Hence, due to my disappointment, iam giving this review one star...!",7.0,0

"Samsung Galaxy Note 5 SM-N920A 64GB GSM Unlocked Cellphone, Black",,549.0,5,Had this device for a short time... but already I am loving it.I'm not gonna do a detailed review here because there's already a million of them online... so for specifics and details check out YouTube for great review videos.What I will point out is that this is the international version... that has some pros and some considerable to it.The pros are it's completely unlocked so you can go with pretty much any carrier except Sprint and Versions networks. This also gives ya freedom to switch any time you like as well. Also this device is running lite on the factory installed apps and carrier bloat ware we all hate. That's nice to not have chappy apps ya don't want permanently taking up space on your device.The cons come mainly in software and support. This phone does not support some applications yet mainly Samsung pay... and as an international device it's usually last in line for those apps... plus software updates take a while... those wanting the marshmallow update... like me... will be waiting a while longer as this device is almost last in line. So that kinda stinks. .. also the warranty is handled differently as well.Aside from those little things it's an amazing device and we'll worth the price for the freedom provided by a truly unlocked device.,4.0,4

Unlike some BLU phones, battery for this one detachable. Camera resolution good. Screen quality good enough for my far sighted eyes. Adequate battery life. Large screen.Cons- too large and too heavy (155 g) for me. Even though size and weight average compared to other phones nowadays, I prefer phones with screens 4.7 inches or less and 130 g or less.

Bought this for my best friend for Christmas since she has a job that won't allow her to have her phone at her desk but she is allowed things like smart watches, we wanted to be able to get ahold of her quickly if there was an emergancy at home. She opened it, played with it for about 20 minutes before the screen began to blink and stop responding to any touch on the screen or the button. Sent it back, at my own expense, and had a new one sent out. They did send an extra battery to sort of reimburse me for the shipping costs, which was good because the battery that was on the second watch when it got here exploded shortly after being turned on, but thankfully didn't damage the watch. The description for the item is a little unclear. This doesn't work WITH your smart phone, it IS a smart phone. It needs it's own sim card to be able to use all the functions, My friend almost had me send it back again because the touch screen isn't very sensitive at all. She says it will randomly stop responding to touch when used regularly. For the most part she doesn't really use it because of how frustrated she gets with it being glitchy all the time.",0.0,0

ZTE Z Max 2 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Quad-Core Android Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - Black,ZTE,119.88,5,"WOW, I am very impressed by the Quality and Speed of this Android Smartphone. I am using it with my TRACFONE account (that I transferred from my old cell phone). This phone works very well so far with good features and good reception. The Android part is wonderful with the new Marshmallow 6.01 operating system features. All of my APPS downloaded and installed properly from Google and Amazon app stores and work just as good as on my expensive Tablet. My new ZMAX2 handles even large and Graphically intensive apps with no glitches or problems. I love the large (5 1/2"" viewable) screen with awesome, vibrant display. Also reasonably light weight for it's size and fits fine in my pockets.I do not usually impress easily with new technology devices but this one is a sure winner in my book. And, it cost a fraction of what other comparable devices cost nowadays. I have only had it a few weeks but am very pleased so far. I hope it has a long, reliable life (ha-ha)!",5.0,4

Samsung Galaxy S7 G930F 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone International Version (Black) - NO WARRANTY,Samsung,514.99,5,"(I did purchase this phone from this page and decided to do a quick review of it)This phone was everything I could have asked for. I always had this predisposition that the Samsung phones were made with lower quality materials, but I was dead wrong. This phone is Beautiful! The materials they put into it are top notch and in my personal opinion this device looks and feels much better than the iPhones!When I first got I was worried because I was switching from Apple to Android, which can be a pretty daunting change. BUT the transition did not seem to take long at all. I got into the phone pretty quickly and was doing my normal daily tasks in no time.It is sad that I had to give up FaceTime but I feel like it was worth it and my friends quickly adapted and started calling me on Skype or Oovoo instead.Unlike the name says, this phone did actually come with some type of warranty I believe. On the box there was a ""24 month warranty"" sticker,.. So I am assuming that means I have a warranty!I also was curious to see which phone is faster (the iPhone 6s Plus vs the Samsung Galaxy S7) so I ran a few easy tests. In getting into apps, the Samsung got in just a hair faster. In loading webpages, the Samsung again beat the iPhone just by a hair.The camera on the Samsung is by far the superior camera when there is ample amount of lighting but in low light, I would give it to the iPhone. The front-facing camera, works the same way. In low light the iPhone wins, but with enough light, the Samsung does better.There are many really cool customization options on the Android software that you would have to jailbreak your iPhone to do, and with the type of person I am I feel like the Android software works better for me. On the other hand, Android may be more confusing to use. Things are not always quite right there where you want them to be and you have have to search for them. BUT Android helps you out with this with search bars when they are convenient.Overall this device is everything I could have asked for. I really enjoy it and I hope I can continue enjoying it for as long as possibly",137.0,4

Now the price is much higher but still well worth it.My other phone is a Motorola G3, third generation, the one that is somewhat waterproof, a unique quality of that phone. I have gone back and forth with these two phones and love both of them, but I always come back to the Alcatel. Since I am a musician I value one quality of this phone that very few phone orders give a hoot about, and that's the sound. The sound produced by the speakers of this phone is truly amazing considering that it is just a cell phone. My Moto G sounds tinny by comparison and my wife has a Moto X Pure and even hers can't begin to compare with the sound of the Alcatel. I also love the unique screen size, 4.7 inches, a nice, small size that is easy to manage and has excellent quality as well.The camera is every bit as capable as the Moto G and overall this phone is a most excellent phone, especially for the price.

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,4,"Let me start off by saying that I am not very tech-savy. I am on the Tmobile prepaid unlimited everything. I had been looking for an internet capable phone for quite sometime, as I was paying for a data plan I was not using. I purchased this phone after much research on android phones. What sold me on this phone was the price. Because I have the prepaid plan, I was going to have to pay in full for an unlocked android phone, which can be over $300. I found this phone on Amazon, and was imediatally in love with it, because it can everything that I wanted it to do and it was at an affordable price of $200.I like this phone for many reasons. It is a 4G capable phone so I get signal almost everywhere. I like the way that the texting is set up (gingerbread interface, I think that is what it is called). This phone comes preloaded with swype, which i had never used before until now. Swype is pretty easy to use I just drag your fingure across the letters in the word that I are trying to spell and it writes out the word for me, so no more hunt and peck. Another thing that I like about the phone is that it is wi-fi capable. I like many other things about this phone, these are just some examples.I have only had a cupple of problems with this phone. Sometimes the phone is not very responsive to my touches on the touch screen, though is rare. The only other problems that I have with the phone are that occasionally my phone will not send texts and rarely it will freeze up. Both of these problems are fixible by simply restarting the phone or pulling the battery. I have had no other problems with phone other than those things.Over all I think that this is a pretty nice andriod phone, and totally worth the money. It is a great deal for all the things that you get.",2.0,4

"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,2,"Used this phone for a couple of months. Comparing with my old Samsung SGH 900, here are my general impressions/experience1. Android 2.3 is certainly a lot more user friendly than dodgy win 6.52. The device does not have enough hardware, however. Camera resolution is too small -- making indoor pictures highly pixeled.3. Touch-responses are too sluggish. Delays are annoying. If you used any device like iProducts, the sluggish responses are unbearable.4. The phone required frequent reboots.

There is not word as to when OS can be upgraded to android 4.0.xIn summary, this phone is not worth the money given the sluggish/unresponsive, outdated Android OS, and frequent-rebooting user experience.I wish to have spent money on a quad-core, or at least a dual-core smartphone, which would give much better user experience.",3.0,0

Samsung Galaxy S III S3 T999 GSM Unlocked Android Smartphone - Marble White,Samsung,116.99,5,"I'm a bit of a novice on buying phones since I have always gone to a provider and selected a phone they happened to carry, even if it was not exactly what I wanted. I had some basic needs including compatibility with my blue tooth in my car, that it would work with the new carrier I had chosen, and that it was truly new and unlocked. In searching I found many phones that were questionable as to whether or not they were unlocked, contacted the respective sellers, and never heard back. This told me they weren't. If you care about new, be careful that you are not actually ordering a pre-owned phone. Nothing wrong with that, but if you want new, be sure that is what you are getting.The information on this phone didn't specify what was coming in the box, so I did order a battery just in case it didn't come with one. It did. In the box were a new phone, headset, battery, USB cable, plug in charger, and quick start instructions. I charged the phone, called the carrier I intended to use where they verified the phone was unlocked, and had them send me a sim card. When it arrived I installed the card, phoned the carrier about a piece of info I could not find (the IMEI,which can be found by entering *#06# on the telephone keypad), activated it, and I was off and running. The blue tooth connection in my vehicle worked on my first try.I don't know how anyone could improve their experience with this seller. The phone is perfect, and came packaged as securely as a person could make it. I would buy from this seller again based on my personal experience.",0.0,4

FYI, clean your screen really well before putting on the plastic casing and make sure there is no lint on your screen or the clear screen protector. Seems like I will be taking it out of the case to clean the screen...over time, somehow lint and dust get in it.

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,408.0,4,"First, I want to warn you that I have always loved Sony phones since it was Sony Ericsson. I still remember one of my older phones was a Sony Ericsson K550 that had a 2MP camera but produced pictures with the highest quality. After a disappointment with a Sony Ericsson C901 I decided to switch to Nokia from 2009 until 2013 when I bought a Sony Xperia GO that worked perfectly for 27 months until this November.I decided to buy a Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and after one week I think I can share my experience with all of you.This is a good phone. I know some people would never even consider getting a Sony phone but even they admit Sony is just quality. This phone has an excellent hardware and the way it integrated with the software (Lollipop working perfectly) is what I would call excellence. Connectivity is good since I can connect to 4G (LTE) without any trouble but you need to make sure this phone supports your carrierâs LTE band.Call quality (Letâs remember we still make phone calls with smartphones) is good and I have not had any issues with reception at all. The phone is thick but not as extremely thick as some people have complained. Itâs noticeable in your pocket but nothing gross. Itâs not heavy or uncomfortable. I have to mention at this point that inserting the SIM card and the memory card is not easy. I swear Iâll never open those slots again. I inserted a 64GB memory card and itâs working flawlessly.The screen delivers beautiful colors and the resolution is excellent. I know some people have complained it could have been better but still is very good. One of the main reasons I love Sony Xperias is because they usually have anti-scratch protection and I witnessed it with my previous Sony Xperia Go as it never got a single scratch in 27 months. The camera has been controversial in some reviews. Look, I know we should believe that smartphones will replace digital cameras but guess what? I donât think so. The camera takes very good pictures and delivers excellent videos but itâs true it is not perfect. However, the camera is good for most occasions.Sound quality is excellent. I used PowerAMP for my music and this phone has a special feature to improve the overall sound quality with headsets (DSEE HX). It works perfectly and I havenât had to arrange and tweak the PowerAMP equalizer all over as I did with my previous Sony Xperia GO.Battery life is good but not as other smartphones. If you listen to a lot of music (like me) youâll need to charge the phone every single day. This is not a problem for me but I know some people might not like it. However, I have to mention that one day I almost didnât use it and it just discharged from 99% at 7AM to 90% at 7PM so it really depends on usage. Another advantage is that it charges very quickly.The phone is very responsive and I have not experienced any bugs or lags as someone reported before. The camera works pretty well when I click on it taking just one second for the app to open.At this point you must be asking why Iâm giving it only 4 stars and I am going to tell you why: heat.Unfortunately, the phone does get warm when you update apps or run another âintensiveâ process. Itâs not all the time so I think Sony has done something maybe not to fix the problem they had before but at least to alleviate it. I want to clarify it gets warm â nothing extreme but still noticeable.This is an excellent phone, really. Itâs quality and performance all in one but the heating issue should have been fixed by Sony at this point.",9.0,0

The device is well built, and definitely has a premium feel. It's not as well built as the HTC one M8, but HTC has become the standard for build quality so they're hard to beat in that front. The LG G3 not only has a small footprint for a phone with a 5.5"" display but the 2K resolution is astounding. LG includes videos inside of the phone that you can watch with 2K display, and it really is mind blowing. My next step, is to buy a Qi Wireless charger, I already bought one and will update my review once I receive it. Overall, the device is exactly what I expected but in a smaller and more compact form factor than I thought.Update 10-20:I went ahead and bought the Choe Qi Wireless Charger which is sold here on Amazon, and I have to say, it's quite good. The only issue that I have seen is that it gets really hot quickly. I think that might have to do with the rubberized back of the Choe Qi Wireless charger but I can't say for sure. Overall, this version does indeed have Qi Wireless capabilities (For those that want to know) and it does work as intended.Update 1-4-15:This phone has been just as amazing as the first day I got it. This was also the first non-Nexus device to get the Android Lollipop update. Since receiving the update last week, LG has already put out another update to fix some minor flaws with the Lollipop update. Overall, I would still give this device a 5 stars even if I bought it today.",6.0,4

And now the price is dropping even further down. With phones like this one and the next gen in 2014, iphones will have a tough time selling soon although they have a niche market and people are seemingly Apple-lifers. If you use an iphone 5S for a week and then put your hands on the LG G2, you would realize what most already know- Android rules & LG is providing superior tech without all the high price of Samsung and Sony. Don't get me wrong, I was a big supporter and user of the iphone and Galaxy lines, and maybe I'll change to something different in the future- however, Google with their open-source method and rapid adoption by developers and outrageous number of choices and ''free'' apps, it would be near impossible to think of an alternative.

Better than the new gen bb's.....WHY??? easy. they are stable, sturdy and the operating system is super stable. The new ones are an android rendition that in my opinion is cheap at best.",0.0,4

She has really bad eyesight from cataracts and has to have a bright screen to see. On all her previous phones, she always had to turn the brightness up all the way which killed the battery. Not so on this phone because the screen is bright already. The battery lasts really well and she's on it constantly playing games and such.

Hopefully this will replace my Note 3, which has been about a 3 star phone, IMHO.This phone so far looks awesome. I'm very happy with it. Fast, and not drastically larger than the note. But the screen is bigger, brighter and it comes with software that seems to work (++ over the samsung).Set up was fast and easy... basically insert sim, transfer stuff over, and go.I've owned a note 2, and a note 3... this is better, so far.1 week update;Very happy, phone is working great.Couple small pet peeves:*The touch pal keyboard takes some getting used to*The lack of lights under the home buttons is annoying (found an app that allow for home keys on the screen)*the battery life could be better, if you use it a lot, you're gonna need to recharge before 12 hours. PRO;The battery charger included is a welder! Very rapid charging.More data, a solid week + of ownership.Pros:*128GB sd card is in and working*the machine is fast, and handles most anything I throw it it.*the battery (or power management) is def superior to what I was experiencing with the Samsung Note 3The screen. It's really beautiful. I'm near sited, adn even I can't see the pixels, AT all. Should bbe great with cardboard, etc.Cons:*Bluetooth is a little cranky. I've had a couple problems, and I don't know if it's the Phone, my Moto 360, or the google 5.1 OS. The watch disconnected, and it took a LOT of effort for this user to get it back to good.*Bluetooth pairing in general seems worse than usual (I'm not a fan of BT, it seems I always have trouble with it). Rebooting before, during and after a new pairing is not out of the ordinary. (I have a lot of speakers and stuff!)*The stock keyboard is touchpal, which is OK, but doesn't work as smoothly as what I'm very used to (the sammy kb). I'm trying the Swiftkey KB now. Better, but still not ideal. Of course, it has full app store, so you can put in whatever KB you want.*WIFI range is not as good as the Note 3. Out in the yard, it loses connection easily, even close to the home. works inside, but can be a little slow if far from the router.* I still miss the sammy's pen, tho! ;-)* And actually the multi-window capability of the nnote was kinda cool too. Not too useful, but I did use it sometimes.AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS:I'm very happy with the phone. There was a sofftware update that fixed some quirks, (I've never owned a smartphone that didn't have some quirks.)I would recommend this to anyone looking for a larger phone.",16.0,0

I've had this phone 6 days and will probably return it in a week if it doesn't get better.I am a long-time Nokia customer, most recently the E71. The E71 is a great phone and although I wanted a bigger screen, I might just buy a new one if this E7-00 doesn't work out.This is my first touch-screen phone and all the reasons I didn't want a touch screen are present in this phone. The saving grace is the keyboard, which has a good feel to it and is very easy to type. The touch screen is so sensitive that I could blow on it and the keys activate. Very annoying. I read somewhere that the sensitivity can be adjusted, but haven't had time to find out if this is true.Upon receipt of the phone on Saturday, I immediately updated to Anna, thinking that would prevent the problems that others complained about. Unfortunately I think Anna comes with its own set of issues and I don't think that Nokia Customer Care is very forthcoming about.I have played around with the setting for the past few days, getting everything set-up and MAY be using it more trying to get everything setup than I would be as a regular user. I am trying to justify why the battery life has gone from 36 hours the first day, down to less than 8 on the 5th day. The only thing that I have running all of the time is Bluetooth. Wi-Fi is not continually on, internet use is maybe 30 minutes daily, may have 45 minutes of phone conversation daily and send at most 10 texts a day.....That should not account for the ridiculous battery life.I deleted the 3rd home screen and have tried numerous suggestions found on the internet to help with battery life, but so far it is getting worse every day.The biggest problem that I have with this phone is that you cannot hear the wonderful navigation system through the Bluetooth headset, nor apparently a Bluetooth car-kit. My own research over the past few days tells me that this version of Nokia Maps was designed this way, either listen over the E7 loudspeaker, or the wired headphones that came with the phone. As I usually have a few kids in my car, it is not an opportune environment for trying to hear anything, especially if you have to hold the phone to your ear, as the loudspeaker is not really loud. And why would I want to have a Bluetooth in my ear for calls and have to connect a wired headset to my other ear to hear the navigation.When I called Nokia to ask about the Bluetooth and Navigation issue, the rep didn't appear to know anything about it. After allowing her to link up remotely and resetting the phone (losing all of my settings, but not the data) she said that the problem was with my bluetooth and that I needed to get a Nokia Bluetooth headset in order to hear the navigation. This bothers me on so many levels, the first being that Bluetooth connectivity should be standardized. Secondly, I don't have the problem on my E71 using any type of Bluetooth. Why would a higher level and higher priced phone give you fewer options? Third, why are there so many complaints about this issue, but I have not once seen anyone offer that a Nokia Bluetooth headset will fix the problem.Although I am planning to buy a new Bluetooth (my new Jawbone is soooo uncomfortable), I would be pretty upset if I go through the trouble of buying a Nokia Bluetooth and it still doesn't work with the voice navigation.The Bluetooth issues continue as it is very difficult to pair with this phone. I've tried a new Jawbone, 2 month old Motorola, and various other Bluetooth from friends...same problem. It might take 9 or 10 tries before the pairing goes through. That is unacceptable.And finally the phone is resetting itself on a continual basis when I drive in certain parts of the city. It might reset 5 or 6 times within 10 minutes. I don't know if this is the phone, carrier or just my bad luck, but it is very annoying.Update 11/17/11 Phone just died. Phone is getting hot, cannot power off nor are any of the other buttons active. Nothing happens when you hold it down for 8- 15 seconds. Screen is white with black lines, almost like an old black & white TV when the horizontal tuning is messed up. Back it goes to Amazon. Hate it even more now. I have NEVER had a problem with Nokia phones before, but this is a piece of junk.",4.0,0

Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty,Nokia,99.99,3,"UPDATE AUG 2016: A few critical items to add to this review, and this should probably knock the stars down (was 4 stars, May 2016): First, I mentioned that I didn't update the phone to 8.1 and as it turns out this was part of my good luck with this phone. When you do the update, you absolutely lose Internet Sharing. There are some kind of hokey tricks you can find on the net to restore this, and one of these may work, but anyway, this is a massive feature loss. Next is that you cannot update this phone to Windows Phone 10. I still have two of these and partly did the 8.1 update to see how much further it could go. 8.1 is it. You can't go further and apparently it's official from Microsoft now that this phone cannot be upgraded to Windows 10 even though it has plenty memory. Finally, Microsoft in their wisdom removed an app from the store called ""Lumia Storage Check (beta)"" that added a critical capability to this phone: storage of map data for Here Drive/Here Maps on the SD card. Even with Windows Phone 8.0, this app gives a message that ""This app is not available for your device."" It seems Microsoft might have made this app completely non-downloadable with these phones even though you can visit it by direct link (link follows). With this app, you could download maps for entire USA to your SD card and it would cost you about 5 GB. This was awesome, because it meant you could travel anywhere in the US and never need to download maps. It makes the app faster and everything better and *used to be* one of the things I would promote on this phone. So of course, Microsoft killed it, probably because they want the moment by moment data of where you are exactly for marketing reasons. Microsoft has no respect for your privacy and they are as bad as Google. (Link to the app so you can check it yourself:[...]I have purchased *three* of these phones in the last month, and let's start with the bad, but keep reading for the good, and the bad is that God knows where these phones come from, though they *appear to be* more or less new as claimed.So here's the bad. The first phone was a complete dud and had this problem that others had mentioned out here: the phone just would not charge! When I pulled it out of the box and turned it on, all appeared to be OK. But it was like it was ""stupid"" about accepting a charger. Once dead, it never turned back on at all, even sitting on the charger for hours! A very strange thing that I've never seen. The seller, who probably didn't know much more about the oddness of this phone than me, thought it was a bad battery and sent me one of those. With this new battery inserted I was again able to turn the phone on! (Because it had irretrievably died.) But the challenge was keeping it running as it would take something like 10 hours to fully charge! I got a battery monitoring app, and this phone was truly weird, taking enormous amounts of time to charge if it was able to charge at all.Needless to say, this first phone went back.I then purchased another one of these same phones (masochist?) from a different seller (not a masochist?) and perhaps just by dumb luck, I had no problems. The two phones came identically packaged. Both the bad and the ""good"" appeared to be completely new. They were still in shrink-wrap in what appeared to be an original Nokia box. They both had a little identification sticker on the outside of the shrink-wrapped plastic. The only difference was that the first ""bad"" one had no screen protector, and you know, these things always have screen protectors when they're new. Both appeared perfect though and new. Now the bad here from any point of view is that these were both *AT&T* phones that apparently had been somehow unlocked. Both phones (the bad and the good) had the AT&T logo in the upper right corner. Both phones had goofy AT&T apps that I didn't want. Both phones would show the AT&T logo when turning on. (Note that both phones were ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" which is the only way I will generally buy a product on Amazon that is sold by a third party seller and that appears to be ""potentially shady."")My intent was to use these on T-Mobile, so I wasn't too thrilled about the AT&T background. I figured I'd have some weird problems with the phone, even if it appeared to more or less work. So the first feature I tried was the mobile hotspot, because I use that and it's very easy to access on all these Windows Phones. So that worked a treat out of the box and seemed to be a little faster than my old Nokia 4G T-Mobile phone. Anyway, it was pretty much to me blazing fast for a cell phone hotspot, at about 4000 Mbits/sec.So that was great. And the phone seemed to work just fine on T-mobile without any issues with texting or with voicemail, etc. But I thought that too soon because there was one issue, and that was with sending pictures in text messages. I noticed this only after a couple weeks with the phone when I needed to do this. It flat out didn't work. I would send the message and like 5 minutes later I'd get a message from the phone that the message could not be sent. The fix for this was to set the APNs of both ""internet"" and ""mms"" (in Settings:cellular:""edit internet/mms apn""). After that all was well with texting.So, it's now about a month later, and this second phone has had no battery issues whatsoever. It seems to charge completely normally and it takes almost precisely 1.5 hours from dead to full charge. As I mentioned I have a battery monitoring app and it is quite nice and tells me exact info on these things. (""Battery Sense"" is the name of the app and I'd strongly recommend it, though it has ads.)The battery life when the phone is on is not spectacular, but previously I had a definitely brand new and ""unshady"" Nokia 521 and its battery life was none too fantastic either, and overall this phone I would say is about the same. The crazy bright screen on this phone which cannot be dimmed much is probably a big reason the thing sucks down juice quickly when being used, because it does seem to run down more quickly when it's doing something I would say, but when not much is going on with the phone, the steady drain seems normal and if I'm not using it as a hotspot during the day or doing a long video, it should make it through the day fine. I would say for sure it has to be put on the charger every night though.So I bought a second phone from the second seller (making three Nokia 820s total, the first from the other seller) and that one too has not had battery issues (knock wood). It charges normally and has normal battery life and everything seems OK.So I have to say I really like this phone except for the stupidly bright (and battery draining) screen and it seems like a very nice upgrade over my Nokia 521. This phone fills the gaps that the 521 had, like the 521 having no flash.I have always had smartphones with a flash, so it was a little irritation with the 521 to not have that. Now I have a flash again, and it's been great, particularly as a flashlight which is probably the main purpose of a flash on these phones. And this phone has a great flash that also enhances the pictures, more than I would expect of a cheap LED flash. Pictures are great on this phone, as I think they tend to be on this vintage of Nokias. This one seems to have an upgraded camera as well over the 521 and it is very nice. The 521 has an amazing camera for its price, and takes quite nice video again for the price, and so this phone does that and does it better. The flash really seems to improve picture quality more than I would have expected and the pictures have a really tightly focused and nicely lit and color balanced quality. The flash particularly helps I think because the phone uses the flash to figure out exposure settings even when you have the flash turned off and that seems to work fantastically. For example, close-ups with this phone come out great. So this phone is much better than the 521 camera-wise and the 521 as I say was very good.There's also a front facing camera which honestly I don't use much but I know to lots of people this is a key feature.The major big upgrade with this phone is speed though as it is observably faster than the 521, and I'm talking about user interface responsiveness and such. With the 521 I wrote a review saying that the Windows 8.1 upgrade was *not good* partly due to the slow-down. With this phone I can tell that that would be less of a concern, but still I am not upgrading to 8.1 as I particularly don't like the ""androidization"" of the top of the screen and I also don't like that stupid and overdone Cortana thing as it's a dumb form of Siri imitation and it *makes things take longer.* This phone still has that same female voice, but it's not irritating and making everything slower and it's not in your face with its clever ""personality."" It just works and shuts the hell up as much as possible which is how it should be.Anyway, back to performance, the huge selling point of this phone has to do indirectly you might say with speed, and it's the 1 GB RAM versus the Nokia 521's 512 MB RAM. So this phone doubles the RAM, and RAM is a critical need on these phones, especially when you're talking about potentially doing the updates.So even though there was the initial problem with one of these, I really like this phone and the main bad feature is the stupidly bright screen, which contributes to the other bad feature which is the battery life not being a huge improvement over the 521 I previously had. Note that every iPhone out there allows you to dim the hell out of the screen *out of the box* - no app needed! This feature is sometimes a critical need when you are somewhere where you cannot charge and need to conserve juice at all costs! This is not an ""optional"" feature on a cell phone but a must have! Let us turn down the stupid screen ffs!So that's the massive bad feature in this phone which was not a problem on the 521. The 521 has the same limited settings but has a fairly dim screen at the lowest settings. But all in all, this is a nicer, quicker, more full-featured phone than the 521, and still at a ridiculous price! (Note: I paid $110)",,2

It also has no built in photo editing options.Hands down the most durable phone I have ever had and when the 3 years is up, i will trash it to get a new one, then when it dies out of warranty i will buy another!!!! I'll never buy a regular phone again.Did I mention it's water proof?? Ever get a call while you are in the shower? Just take it with you now. It's the easiest way to clean grit and grease off too i use my hand/nail brush to scrub it clean once a week while i'm in there.",12.0,0

A little after that it would turn on but stay on the apple then turn off. I couldn't be on my phone at all. I had to get it fixed for $60 not a lot , but this is when they raised the price and I had to pay $310 for my phone.

"Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Nokia,79.0,4,"I bought this phone mainly because I couldn't afford the high cost of AT&T's iPhone monthly packages. I'm also not one of those people who need their phone for business, so I passed on a blackberry. However, I find it extremely useful to be able to go online without needing to be near a computer. e.g when I'm lost in NYC and even the locals can't direct me (Google Maps is great right?). I can also connect to my wireless network with ease when I'm at home and chilling on the sofa and can't be bothered to get my laptop. I like the fact that I can store music on this phone, take pics and videos (although not the best quality, especially at night) and listen to the radio. Its an extremely good phone in my opinion and I'm glad I made the purchase. Also, because I can get unlimited Web deal from my phone company for $10, my bills are much more affordable than they would be if I had the iPhone from AT&T.However....its a little bulky compared to the iPhone and most blackberries. For me that's cool because it slips out of my pocket less than my other phone and I drop it less too (I'm one of those annoyingly clumsy people!). What annoys me the most though is the fact that there is no alphanumeric keypad option when you want to make calls. Its only available for text messages and web browsing. Fine if you're in Europe where phone numbers are always given numerically, but in the US, phone 'words' are used all the time, so you either have to memorize the alphanumeric keypad or switch to text messaging to type out memorize the number form of the word.Despite those minor flaws (in my opinion), a very good phone indeed!",4.0,4

I admit I'm worried because of the other reviews I have read and this is the first time I have strayed from Nokia phones (now made by Microsoft). I'm giving it 5 stars and will redo if phone doesn't work as one would expect. This is day one, Jun 25th, 2016. July 4th and still happy as a clam. Added second sim card today (AT&T) original Sim is T-Mobile.

A few miles away from where I was and I received 4G LTE so all is great with both the SIM from AT&T and T-Mobile. Jul 9th and I am still in love with this phone. I should mention that if your big on downloading apps for your phone not all apps are made for the windows phone. Great phone, just didn't take off with people and I'm sure it is because of the app issue.Still the best phone, I dropped it into the toilet the other day, figured it was toast but pulled it out within a few seconds and it is still working.The case supplied with the phone seems to have kept it dry.

I kind of feel like I got a downgrade instead of an upgraded phone. Does not save messages as a draft if you have to take a call while making a text, sometimes I see my pictures in my gallery, sometimes not. It is herky jerky no matter what you are trying to do, whether it's typing a text, loading an app, or simply answering the phone. Since I have had it, people I speak to on the phone are complaining that it sounds like there is a monk chanting on the line while we are trying to converse, making it difficult for the person trying to hear me, although I never do hear the sound myself. I often have trouble connecting whether I make a call or receive a call, where there is just silence on the other end and neither of us can hear each other. My husband tried to call me the other day while I was at the store, and he told me it rang twice, there was silence, then more ringing, and then some guy answered. I also get 3G very spottily, very occasionally I will get it, usually it is just edge, ONCE in a great while, 3g will pop thru for no apparent reason, and then disappear just as inexplicably. The worst problem I have had so far is not being able to send or receive pictures in a message, which it seems I was able to fix by downloading an app off of Google Play. The app is called Tweakker, it changes your APN settings to the correct configuration for the network you are using. I had been playing around with the APN settings, trying to get MMS to work to no avail, but finally seem to have found success with this app, and that is about the only truly positive thing I can say about this phone so far.Update, I have also discovered that the phone does not have any GPS. There are many apps I have tried which also use the phone's magnetic sensors and GPS that don't work on this phone. I mean, for a cheap phone, it looks nice, is heavy and appears well put together in a durable case, but dayam, it don't do shit, it doesn't even do half what my old galaxy did. All I can really say about it is that you can make and receive calls and texts. If you are only looking for a phone that has a certain look to it, and you don't care about what it does or how well it works, you'll like this phone, otherwise DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",2.0,0

I've thrown it, kicked it, gotten it wet, and dropped it at least a hundred times (even on concrete) and the worst that's happened is my cat scratched the screen protector that it comes with. The screen underneath was fine and I ended up buying a glass screen protector for it for $10. I am a young professional in a corporate, technical world and I'm constantly using my phone for everything. I swear, this phone does absolutely everything you need it to... except for this....CONS:Internal Storage SpaceI have a decent sized SD card in it with plenty of room but that doesn't matter. Over the past year, this phone has slowly filled up with app updates, media, etc. and I simply can't delete or move anything else. I've cleared out my photos, deleted all but my most crucial apps, googled everything I could possibly do to free up space but here I am, wanting to download Favor so I can get some tacos delivered and there just isn't any room left. I've spent the last few months fighting it and trying so hard to convince myself that this phone is worth it but I'm tired of having to go through my storage every few weeks just so Gmail can update.

I could live with that but this phone gets far less signal than my previous BLU phones (same SIM, same network). It also drops it's data connection quite often regardless of the amount of bars I have. I also have a lot of trouble dialing calls out with this phone. Usually only 1 out if every 4 attempts actually dial out, and that is usually only after having to restart it, or turning airplane mode on then off again.

Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl-Zeiss Optics Camera - White,,99.99,5,"I have been using the phone for 3 weeks now and I have to say that it surpassed my expectations. I will give some pros and cons that I have noted so far:Pros:Battery life: I was a bit concerned about the battery life of the phone because I had read some negative reviews so I was really relieved when I found out that the battery life was amazing. So far I have never had to recharge more than once a day and the average battery life has been about 30 hrs. Considering that the phone is new and I cannot keep my hands off it, I have configured 3 email account (manual synchronization only), I have been shooting quite a lot of pictures and I have been doing a lot of texting I would say that the battery life is more than great.Screen: The screen is nothing less than amazing. I love every aspect of it. The colors, the oleophobic lair on it make it the best display I have used so far. The filter for the blacks is really doing its job and I feel almost like I am using an amoled display.Camera: No need to comment it. It is the best I have used on a mobile device.Size: This is a matter of personal preference but I love the weight of the device and the bulkiness. It feels great in my hands (although I have relatively big hands and this might be one of the reasons). The 4.5"" are more than enough to enjoy the great display.Applications: Although not many applications are available for win8(compared to Android and IOs at least) all that I have installed work extremely well. I like the fact that the applications are stored on the flash memory when I switch between them and this is not draining battery. When I go back to the app it loads very fist though and I do not feel any delay (this is a bit subjective I suppose).Cons:Some times I have problems synchronizing the email. I have to try several times (2 times on average) before the email gets synched. This does not happen every time but it is a bit annoying. But no matter this little problem - the email client is amazing. I really love reading my emails on it.Skype: sometimes when I go in and out from skype several times it does not start. The screen remains on resuming and after 20-30 seconds the application closes. I have not had this problem with any other application and it is not a deal breaker in any case.Apps: there are not so many games and apps in general. This is a disadvantage in general but actually I like it. I have not installed any games yet and probably that is the reason I am so pleased with the battery life :). I really love temple run and it is available for win8 as well but I have refrained from installing it so far. I have my nexus 7 for games!Facebook integration: Sharing pictures with facebook is not as easy as on android. It is not very intuitive but there is such an option.Final words: The device is amazing. I was pleasantly surprised from the user experience form the win8. This is my first phone with win8 and I have to admit - I am loving it :).",5.0,4

In my case, touch is not working at top left corner an I read in One plus forums, many of them reported the same complaint and the only solution yet was Uninstall Face Book Messenger app from your mobile. I did the same and it was working fine now.And apart from the above issue,I have been facing another most weird issue is that Lyca mobile network is not at all compatible with One plus. The Signal is fluctuating continuously, some times I lost the data and sometimes lost complete network and see only Emergency calls only and immediately get the full signal after a minute. But I haven't seen this issue in the forums, may be I am the one using this Lyca and One plus combination. And have tested my one plus mobile by keeping different lyca SIMs but still the same issue persists and the SIMs fine with another mobiles. And even tested One plus with other network provider called T-Mobile, no issues with T-Mobile.I did a google search about the frequency bands supported by One plus are covered by Lyca but still the combination is NOT at all GOOD.Apart from these two complaints, as of now piece is OK and recommendable to buy if both issues get fixed.",0.0,0

Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,229.99,3,"I purchased the Mate 2 and received it on 06/26/2014. I love the device for the price of $299 but there were some things that I think should have been updated with this product being it is the face of Huawei in the US. First and most important it should have been updated to Kit Kat either out of the box or as an update once on Wi-Fi, this would have attracted more customers to the phone. Notification Reminder, when you receive a text or email they need to add an option to put a reminder. You get busy doing things and you would forget someone text you or you received an email so it would be nice to set a reminder like every 2 minutes. The phone does have a light indicator which blinks but they made it too small for a 6.1â screen especially when you are outside and mine being a white color you cannot really tell in the sunlight areas. One other thing if your charging your phone the light will not blink if you get a text or email so that sucks, you have your phone on vibrate or mute you will not know you got a notification if it is charging because on vibrate it only vibrates once when you receive the notification. It has a feature that I like which is a pop up message, this is so you can do a quick reply to a text without stopping what youâre doing like surfing the web or watching a movie. The only issue with this feature is when you are texting back and forth and youâre on the text conversation you still get the pop up message, it would be nice if the phone determine when your already in the conversation it would not pop up I had an LG Optimus G Pro and It had this feature and it determined when I was in the text conversation. ONE MAJOR thing with this phone is the LCD screen, some customers out there are experiencing issues with when you tap the phone there is like flash in the background where you tapped, if you YouTube this phone you can see some videos which I posted one myself. I returned my Mate 2 because of this issue plus when I had a white background you can see a white spot in the LCD screen(itâs in my video). I will try another Mate 2 and see if it was just my phone and if not then Huawei needs to fix this ASAP, $299 is still allot of money for an average phone. Hope this Helps",4.0,0

Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - Global GSM Unlocked Phone,Motorola,109.99,5,"Before getting this phone, I tried several other ""cheap"" phones -- a blu phone and an RCA phone. Both were terrible, and I returned them. However, the Moto E was a different story all together. The battery life is great. the call quality is great. Even the camera isn't so bad. My daughter has been taking pictures with it, and to tell you the truth, sometimes I think they are better than my Note 2 (sans flash). There is an issue with the internal memory being only 4 gb. I did get around it but it requires rooting the phone. That's not too hard thanks to Motorola. Once I did that, I bought ""link2sd"" in the google play store which really helped with space (sd card, too, of course). DU speed booster also helped clean up some crud, and then, I went into the system files to delete old copies of android system apps that have been updated by google play as well. If you do that (it's not really that hard), you have a phone that's just about as good as anything twice or even three times the price as the Moto E. What a great phone, and it's unlocked, too!",,4

Since day one something was kind of fishy with it anyway. But I sent it back for exchange and received it last night, and everything is going great! Will update review in a few weeks though! Hopefully the sellers will send the phone out updated with the newest and fastest software versions available for this device, it really is important that the customers get the best experience with it, they will appreciate you for it sellers!

When I received the phone and contacted Verizon Wireless to activate the unit, the MEIN had been previously assigned to another account since 2009...and it was associated with a Samsung Reality. I called Verizon's technical support dept; then I stopped in at a Verizon location. No one could help me since the phone was already assigned to someone else.

"Samsung 32GB Galaxy Note 10.1"" Android 4G LTE Wi-Fi Dual Camera Unlocked Tablet",,499.99,4,"Bear in mind you're buying a product that's about two model-years old now, so don't expect miracles from it. It's a solid device for my purposes, which are basic workplace productivity types of tasks. I use the s-note functions a lot (I also have a note phone), and I have come to be quite reliant upon those apps. Very good interface, once you get used to it. I don't know why tablets are moving away from the stylus -- unless they're going to introduce bluetooth styluses that do the same things?Anyway, my only real gripes about this tablet are:1. Charging seems really slow. Like, really slow. To get from 50% to 100% can take what seems like hours.2. The s-pen is supposed to prevent your palm from interacting with the s-note program -- which it does 95% of the time. Every now and then, it randomly zooms because of something my palm is resting on.3. It gets oddly slow now and then -- possibly because I'm expecting too much? Anyway, I find that a reboot every day or two helps with the slowness.4. Data transfer by USB seems slower than I expected, but that may be unrealistic expectations on my part.Video looks great, on the rare occasions I use it, and the audio is surprisingly good. Lots of aftermarket covers are available for this device -- try a few to find the one you like. Some people want the cover with the keyboard built into it, but I'd rather carry a bluetooth keyboard separately, because sometimes I just don't care about having the keyboard available to me. Sometimes I only want the compact tablet device. The nice thing is that this one isn't exactly a laptop replacement, but for a weekend of travel in which you want to do more than you can do on your phone but you don't want to lug around a laptop, it works just fine. And it's easier to get one of these through airport security than it is to get a laptop through -- you don't have to take the tablet out of your bag. Or at least, I don't have to.Oh, and I have this same tablet in both this version (my wife's, actually) as well as my own tablet -- mine doesn't have the 4G LTE capability, but I haven't noticed any difference in performance between the two of them. She doesn't use the 4G on hers, and it doesn't seem to affect anything negatively as a result.If you like the idea of an integrated stylus, and you can get this at a good price (sub 400), this is a great option. I know it comes in a smaller size, but i wouldn't want it any smaller than it is. 10.1"" sounds like a bigger tablet, but it's really not that big. Much smaller and I'd have difficulty writing with it.",6.0,4

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Grey,BLU,129.99,3,"It's close to stock, but they changed the launcher to be like the Apple iPhone where all the home screens are just a grid of your installed apps. While some may like that, I did not, so I installed the Google Now Launcher app to get a more traditional Android launcher.BLU also changed the notification shade. At first I was confused at why notifications was categorized as Important and Other, but then while looking at notification settings, I realized what was going on and how I can set installed apps to be Important or not. I do miss stock Android's second swipe-down of the notification shade to get Quick Settings.The phone is responsive enough, plenty of storage space, uses micro-SIM card rather than nano-SIM, has a good camera, and interesting enough actually came with a cover and a screen protector in the box. The phone is good enough that I may recommend this phone to someone I know who is not very technically inclined and their current Android smartphone is almost three years old.One concern though is whether BLU will ever upgrade the phone. It has an old version of Android 5.x Lollipop and so far I haven't seen it get even the monthly Android security updates from Google. So will it ever get Android 6.0 Marshmallow or any of the security updates? A phone that is never upgraded is good for those not technically inclined.",12.0,4

Current flagship phones are too expensive and I don't want to pay for it so looking into mid-tier phones or older flagship phones. I got an alert these were sold from Amazon (not some 3rd party seller) for 350 so I jumped on it. I figured if it didn't work out I could return for credit and buy the various other phones out there unlocked.Pros+ got marshmallow update fairly quickly through autoloader (real easy, everyone should be able to do it)+ large battery to get me through the day+ big screen, curved sides help with holding the phone+ mostly stock android with a few tweaks that make life just a bit easier+ scrolling with the keyboard is literally the biggest thing for me+ on screen keyboard has the best word prediction solution I've ever seenCons- a little flimsy, when i type on the onscreen keyboard there is a noticeable sound and bend or flex- wipe the front face of the phone might cause the slider to move- the back kind of feels weird and is plastic despite this being a flagship phoneMiddle* keyboard, so it's great to have a physical keyboard but it's also a bit small. I don't have large hands or fingers and I found it difficult to type using the keyboard.

BlackBerry Bold 9900 No Contract 4G GSM 5MP HD Global Smartphone - AT&T Wireless,BlackBerry,229.99,3,"Maybe I'm not sufficiently tech-savvy, but for some reason, the seller shipped me a phone that was advertised as having been unlocked and ready for use with AT&T. It simply will not work with AT&T, but only with T-Mobile, consistent with the T-Mobile logo emblazoned on what was supposed to have been an AT&T phone. I had the same problem with another seller shipping me a Blackberry that was supposed to work with AT&T, except that one would only work with Sprint, and Sprint is practically nonexistent in much of South Carolina. Is it something I am not doing, or is there some presumption that customers are supposed to know how to force a phone to function with AT&T. I'm not a mobile phone expert, just a frustrated woman trying desperately to find a device and service that will work at my home and where I go.

I love the optional clock faces and the ability to customize many of them to have quick glances of things like the temperature and my next meeting, providing a short cut from the watch face to each for more detail if I want.

After wanting to purchase the 6p and finally settling on the 5x(due to the 6p's size), I expected a smaller phone. Definitely not complaining about the size though, since the display is a definite improvement from my previous iPhone 4. Very slim, easy to hold design. Only cons I've found, is that it comes with a C type charger. But I can overlook that, since a USB adapter came along with it. The other negative, is that I was expecting to activate it with boost mobile and not have to switch my phone number,(but even though this phone is unlocked, it won't work on boost mobile, so heads up.) I decided to purchase a SIM card from T-Mobile. Also, there is only one front facing speaker, even though it looks like there's two of them(so don't think that one of them is broken) Anyways, love the finger print scanner, and that the time is displayed whenever I pick up or move my phone, without having to unlock it with a finger print.

It has almost no memory space; I bought a 32GB SD card for $13 and (if you plan on downloading any apps whatsoever) I recommend that you just purchase one with your phone and save yourself the trouble. On the function of the phone: it runs slightly slow and there are a few bugs, but its only $100. Looks brand name if you get an opaque case--if you're really that vain. It comes with a charger, decent headphones with built in mic, 2 screen covers (1 pre-applied, 1 extra), a clear sorta-flimsy-but-ok jelly case, and since I ordered the white one it came with an interchangeable black battery cover (my mom ordered black but didn't get a second cover).

SONY XPERIA Z3 D6603 LTE 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) INTERNATIONAL MODEL- COPPER,,299.99,4,"This is a really great phone. I really like it. I use to use Samsung Galaxy smartphones and I hated them. Nothing but frustration. Then I was given an Xperia V with a broken screen. I got the screen replaced and fell in love with the Xperia line of phones. Sony really cares about making quality products. The Xperia V worked so much better then any Galaxy phone I ever had, I kept it for several years. Finally, the GPS antenna went out and I had to upgrade. I knew I would upgrade to another Xperia. After looking and comparing specs, I decided to go with the Xperia Z3. I mean, 3GB of Ram and a 2.5Ghz quad core processor! Find another phone with these specs. Only the latest galaxies come close.This phone is really fast. I just operates like lightening. It has plenty of ram for me to install all of my favorite apps and then some. The phone is slim and has a nice bright screen. Of course I bought a gel case and a tempered glass screen protector right out of the gate.The battery life is awesome! Unlike other phones I have owned, this phone uses almost no power when the screen is off. I charged it to 100% before I went to bed. I unplugged it overnight. The next morning the phone was still at 99%. This phone can do a whole day of standard use (email, facebook, google search, navigation etc.) on a single charge. The GPS on my other phones drained my battery so fast I to keep it turned off unless the phone was plugged in. Not on this Z3. I have had the phone for a month and never have turned the GPS off. I pretty much leave all the antennas turned on (Bluetooth, GPS, WiFi) all the time and the battery still goes all day with lot's left over. I don't play games on my phone so I can't comment about that, but I would guess it would do pretty good.Because this phone is a Sony direct phone (International version), it does not have all the carrier bloatware that other phones have that come from AT&T, TMobile, Verizon etc.I am not going to list all the specs for this phone. If you want a complete list of it specs, go to GSM ARENA and look them up there.So why did I give this phone only four stars. The only negative I can find with this phone is the antenna. The antenna on this Z3 is a lot weaker then the one on my old Xperia V. I travel in the same areas, and I never had a dropped call with my Xperia V. Even in areas where my wife's Galaxy S4 had no signal, my V had 3 to 5 bars. Unfortunately, this Z3, has an antenna about equal to that of my wife's S4. Which means that if we are in a bad area with no signal, neither one of us can make a call. Fortunately, this is not a common event, but it still bothers me that Sony did not keep the strong antenna in the Z3 that they put in the V.",0.0,0

CNPGD [U.S. Warranty] All-in-1 Smartwatch and Watch Cell Phone Red,CNPGD,49.99,1,"From the start it looked nice. I thought it would be great to get a cheap smart watch because I didn't want to spend hundreds on one. It started getting bad once I got into it. You are stuck with only three clock options that you can't change at all and they are all ugly. The function if the watch is slow and never clicks where I want it to. There where no directions with mine so I had to google how to setit up.Also in the description it says all this cool stuff you can do, like stream music through your phone to the watch but that's not true. 90% of what it says it can do you need to insert a separate SIM card for the watch itself. There is no internal storage at all so if you want to store anything you HAVE to have a micro SD. You can not delete or add any apps to the watch so if you don't put in the SIM card you will have a bunch of apps that you can't use. You can get notifications from your phone on the watch but it has terrible settings. You would expect that it would have ring, vibrate, vibrate and ring, and silent. But no they put idiotic names for them for example ""outside"" has it be ring and vibrate. And ""meeting"" is just vibrate. Speaking of vibrate it is terrible. I swear it is louder than the sound. So much stuff moves around in it if you where sitting in class or a meeting and that went off everyone will be looking at you.Overall this watch is garbage and I am returning mine and will be looking somewhere else for a smart watch",3.0,0

Nokia 2720 S40 Unlocked Flip Phone with 1.3 MP Camera with Bluetooth--US Version with Full Warranty,Nokia,264.1,3,"I have lived in 2 different areas where my Samsung SGH-E335 and my SGH-T109 both had poor reception. I constantly had problems with dropped calls, poor call quality, etc... The SGH-T109, which I was still using and still works, also had a very poor headset which I lost. The replacement headset was even worse. See my review atÂ Wireless Solutions Earbud for Samsung SGH-T929 Memoir, SGH-A877 Impression, SGH-T119, SGH-T109.The SGH-T109 reception got so bad I finally had to replace it with this Nokia 2720 S40 unlocked phone. I had previously called T-Mobile and they wanted me to sign a contract for another 2 years for yet another Samsung phone and, for some reason which I am not sure why, another SIM card. BTW, I bought theÂ Samsung T139 Prepaid Phone (T-Mobile)Â as a gift for someone else and it has the same problem, poor reception. WHEN is Samsung going to make a basic flip-phone which has better reception?I took a chance and bought this Nokia 2720 S40 unlocked phone and it works... basically. Now instead of having no bars, at least I get 1 or 2 bars and the other party can understand me. The Nokia is also a better looking phone with silver buttons and a blue case. Unfortunately, the Nokia, compared to the Samsung, has a strange menu system where it is difficult to find basic setup commands or the settings don't exist at all. Also, when I have the phone open, the timed backlight goes off and when I press any button to make it go back on, the button registers on the phone as a command, forcing me to exit whatever I entered. I find this most irritating.There is no mention of a headset on the Amazon description page but a wired headset is included. The Nokia wired headset is better than Samsung's with clearer sound. All I need is a basic cellphone. I don't need a worthless, lousy, 1.3 megapixel cellphone camera since I already have aÂ Canon PowerShot SX210IS 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 14x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 3.0-Inch LCD (Black). I'm not going to pay megabucks to access the Internet with my phone because I have a laptop and a desktop for that. When I'm traveling, if I want to access the 'Net, I can get FREE access using my laptop and WiFi at most motels, many coffee shops, and many small restaurants. I also do not use texting because I don't want to pay 15Â¢ per spam message. I use FREE emails instead.I hope this Nokia will last for at least 3 years. I'll never go back to Samsung cells again. I doubt Samsung will ever get their act together regarding basic flip-phones. BTW, Samsung doesn't really like even remotely, partially (3/5 star) negative reviews of their products so they don't always post them on their own website. They like positive, happy, reviews. Just wanted to let you know.See my PIC's and notes in this product's image section.",0.0,4

Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket I727 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone - Black,Samsung,69.99,3,"These phones (we bought two) were purchased as a way to get my wife and I both transferred to T-Mobile from Verizon on a budget. Let us be clear on one point - this is an old phone. The phones were 2 years old when I purchased them, and they were past the end of support from Samsung. They are 3 years old this month, which is ancient for the times we live in. Despite this, the Skyrocket performed well over the course of the past year of ownership. The speed of the phone is ok, with some lag but not enough to make you want to pull your hair out. Chief concerns are the battery life and tendency to get very warm, but what can you expect for older tech? Another problem that has arisen as of late is the phone's tendency to shut off and continually vibrate every few seconds. This can be fixed by pressing the power button repeatedly.

BLU Win Jr LTE - GSM Unlocked Windows Smartphone - White,BLU,85.09,4,"Bought this device to replace my broken lumia 920, The 920 was a flagship and has specs that hold up today, I cannot fairly compare that to this phone which I picked up very cheap.I picked this up for 46USD shipping included, which is a steal.There was one temporary major draw-back, then live-able draw backs that cost this phone a star.-The temporary major draw back:Screen wouldn't turn on if charging and locked, would have to shut off the phone and restart, which for some reason reset the battery to 1%.Solution: I decided to charge it up past 50, by setting the auto screen lock time to ""Never"" and keeping it on the tap. Before researching the topic I decided to download all updates available; that seemed to work for me, locks just fine.-Minor draw backs:1.Headphone sound doesn't get as loud as my lumia, nor has an equalizer2.Onboard Storage is small: You will NEED an SDcard, I had a 32gb samsung sitting in an old tablet and popped it in only has 3gb left of space out of 4gb.3.Not updatable to windows 10: You really wouldn't want windows 10 on a device with 512mb of ram; Windows 10 stuttered on my lumia 920, so I rolled back the update on that device. I wouldn't update this one either.-Things blown out of proportion in scathing reviews I've read1. Its too slow, sluggish gitters, laggy, or crashes when loading webpages: I used this thing extensively today and ran flash and youtube, 3rd party video webapps, with datasense off and desktop pages preffered, 512 goes a long way on a cellphone OS.2. Music quality: Its fine, earbuds included are terrible though.3.Cellular problems: I am on AT&T switching to cricket soon. I've had no problems on AT&T, I have no idea about any other carriers.4.Display: Yeah you are going to see pixels, and blacks are a little grey. Image is sharp, and aliased lightly. At the resolution it runs at you cant ask for more, also puts a load off the gpu of the device. Win OS homescreen also looks great with more tiles,almost cant even tell its vga res.5. Camera: If you need to take a picture, with moderate detail its there, If you need a cellphone to take beautiful pictures, this device is not for you.-Positives1. Very Stylish, I picked orange. I generally dont like phone cases, but the one provided actually adds to the style of the phone, instead of chunking it up.2. Signal hold, Being downstairs was difficult for my lumia as it would constantly drop connection completely. This thing holds on to one band until it finds another, and when thats gone it finds another. My lumia only switched between 4g 4gLTE and E for edge. I have seen those three plus H, G, H+, I didn't even know these still existed, but this phone uses them to my advantage.3. Efficient use of great processor with almost non-existent ram.Summary: I was going into this buy with hesitation, it came down to ""what to I have to lose for 46 bucks on a smartphone"" I got what felt like a 100$ smarphone that didn't exactly 'blow ' away my expectations, but instead slightly exceeded my expectations by about 54 dollars.",0.0,4

Apple iPhone 6s 128 GB International Warranty Unlocked Cellphone - Retail Packaging (Silver),"Amazon.com, LLC *** KEEP PORules ACTIVE ***",749.99,4,"I bought this phone as pre-owned and gently used about a month ago, and so far have enjoyed using it! Before this I was using the 5s, and in comparison with speed & processing power, this phone is like lightning. I've noticed that photo quality is a bit better-probably because of a higher res screen-as well, but not too different. Also, I accidentally dropped this phone in water (it was fully submerged for a few seconds) and it made a FULL recovery! I dried it out for a day, and at first there were a few hiccups with the screen, but after a few charges, everything's performing just as well as it had before the incident. So apple did deliver with their promise to up their water resistance! My mom had done the same thing I did a few months before with a 5s model and that phone was 100% ruined by water damage.However, this new iOS 10 software (that i had unfortunately no choice but to install) is a complete disappointment! I really enjoyed the iOS 9, and there were a few minor tweaks to that that apple could have done instead to make a more superior iOS version, but I feel the ignored all that and just took it in a completely different direction. They're mostly just small irritations (like how swiping to unlock is no longer a thing), however.",,2

Responding to anything via the keyboard is taxing. it is so small and the digitizer is not ver accurate making for a impractical device.

There is no OTG support, and the USB charging port is so deep all other cables are nearly useless. that is just poor design. the screen is so small most apps, webpages, etc are forced off screen or the text is forced into a intolerable vertical format. The battery is poor and the indicator is useless. The softkeys are lighted only and the light goes out very fast making navigation frustrating... and there are almost no settings to control anything. The settings are not all in one place as you will find trying to change the lock screen image.That said it will run netflix and other streaming services. the bluetooth devices I paired worked fine.

Though perhaps because of the sheer size of the screen, the front facing camera is placed at an awkward position which makes any kind of video calls funky.Feature wise this phone can give the Galaxy S4 a run for its money.Sony has been making great phones since separated from the failed joint venture with Ericsson. Unfortunately, the marketing arm doesn't seem to know a thing or two about the US mobile market. This phone is priced competitively with other ""unlocked"" devices like iPhone and Galaxy S4, but in the US there is almost no meaningful market for ""unlocked"" devices. US consumers are so accustomed to device pricing with network subsidies from 2-year contracts they will scream at $500+ price tags for smartphones even though that is how much these phones are priced outside the US.",1.0,4

I only have this for a couple of weeks now and I've already decided that I'll love it. Once I updated the phone to its most recent version, all the problems I had were gone...actually, the only problem that I had is when the phone's camera crashed and can't start up anymore, and the home screen getting out of the viewable area of the screen of my phone. After the update, it's all gone. Everything is working normally, as it should be.There aren't any included Micro SD Card, so I had to buy one for that.No warranty, although I'm not that clumsy anyway.Very light, lighter than the iPhone.Very thin, even with a case; it's still thin. I used a case made by Spigen.It's fast too! It can browse and handle tasks better than my iTouch. I actually had to scream at it, because I never realized how slow it was.I can't create a very good review about the camera though. My previous phone, which was also my first phone, is a Motorola V3i, has a very sucky quality when comparing it at this age. In short, I don't have any other phones to make a comparison, but I thought the video and picture quality is great.Sound is very loud! I mean the built in stereo. It has a future to be my alarm clock, or at least let me hear the person talk loud enough when I'm using the speakerphone during calls. Played a music with it, crystal clear. Made a call, same thing. I never thought the day would come where I don't have to keep saying ""what?""HDMI, USB, and headphone jack is all at the top of the phone...not a very good place in my opinion, but I guess it's the only place they can go.Lastly, the battery life. Without utilizing the Droid Razr's Smart Action feature, I would be charging the phone every night even when I'm not using it. It has always been the problem of the Razr, so I'm pretty used to it dying really fast, but to others, things could get frustrating...especially when you're in the zone.All-in-all, I love it. It has its pros and cons, but I think it's worth the price. UNLOCKED too! That means I can travel with my baby...the problem would be its SIM. It uses a micro SIM instead of the regular SIM.",0.0,4

Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 16GB White-Unlocked International Phone,Samsung,618.3,3,"I wanted to get the phone unlocked for obvious reasons, but there are a few things I didn't know. For one, it doesn't come with US hardware, like the USB charger is a European model. There is no warranty either, I contact Amazon, they told me to contact where I got it, I think they said World Wide dist., they were short and terse with me. They couldn't tell me how I can register this phone. What's worse is that Samsung doesn't support it either - they made the phone. You can't ask questions because the number n7100 isn't a choice. So that's a big problem right there.I installed a Sandisk class 10 64gb micro sd card, it had the android on the cover. The phone knows it's there, yet there is no install to SD option anywhere on the phone, and most programs don't know from it. Some know it's there, some don't, some backup programs know it's there and can use it. But for the most part it's useless, and I can't find anyone in Samsung that will answer that simple question. I don't want to root the phone, because I don't want to take the chance messing it up. I'm hoping it's a glitch, 4.1.2 is rumored to come out at the end of January, maybe that will be fixed by then.That's why it's a 3.However that aside, it's a great phone. Fast, GPS locks on in seconds (though a little too often since it writes home to google each time you connect). Plenty of apps to get. I found it odd that even though I'm plugged into the USB, that the battery will drain. And the computer won't sync up with it, instead I have to rely on the wifi working.The pen feature is kind of dumb. Mostly it's the software, Samsung made the software and it doesn't flow like the system does. Like you can't drag and drop a file, you have to select by holding down, then move, then click the folder, then select move again, it's kind of tedious. The pen is also really hard to hold onto and that button is a joke, unless you have tiny hands.The size of the thing is rather large, and it's very slippery. Even with a case on it, it slid out of my pocket twice. If you plan on putting it in your pocket, and I place the glass side against my leg, choose a case that is sticky. When the otter box comes here and if it's less then retail I'll buy that. The instructions are terrible though it does come with a help app. The instructions that came with the phone was in 5 languages but not English, but you can download the full version online anyway, and the booklet was mostly for that pen.Everything about the phone is google oriented, and while I'm not totally certain, I think my search results for a map ended up in the google now that's installed. The talking features of the phone work well, they understand most things what I say, I just wish I could teach it my name. The spoken by it works well. The map functions is more than great because you can download 10 miles at a time, though the resolution drops the further away you get. But the maps are huge. But when offline you can browse these as if you were online and get spoken turn by turn instructions. If your online you can choose other routes to avoid traffic. There is a siri like thing on this device that I have yet to figure out. So far everything I asked has been totally ignored. Frankly I don't know what it's even for. I guess it's another gimmick to compete with apple.Graphics are fantastic, bold bright and pretty even. Strong contrast, you'll lose a little detail in the shadows, but everything else looks wonderful. There is a built in updater that will check and install any updates you programs might need. The info is in the notification box. The flash for the camera is a LED, pretty bright and can be used as a flashlight, so that's pretty neat. Oh you might want to get a better USB, I find that it's too short and seems to always pull out, along with that - you'll need the charger for your outlet, if you don't already have one.",11.0,4

"Posh Mobile TITAN Max HD Unlocked Android Dual Sim GSM 6.0"" Extra Large HD Phablet Phone, 8.9mm Slim Design, 13MP Camera and 8GB of Storage. (1 Year Warranty) (International and Domestic use)",Posh Mobile,129.88,5,I have owned a few cell phones since their inception and this is one if the better phones I have used. As stated in the product description it is an Android operation system. It is a very simple system and is easy to setup. The cameras are super clear and easy to switch between self picture taking and front snap shots. The gallery mode is easy to edit and upload. The motion part of the camera is surprisingly clear with little jerk to the movie. The apps in Google Play are many and most are useful. I was particularly interested in the Magic Jack and my online banking apps. The only downside to the phone is the battery life. I get about 6 to 8 hours per charge but this is adequate for my use. I bought this because it works here in the Philippines and many of the other Asian countries nearby. My daughter has an IPhone and even she likes this model.,0.0,4

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 64GB - Sunrise Gold - GSM - US Warranty,,449.99,4,"UPDATE AFTER 6 WEEKS OF USE: I would give this 3.5 stars.frustrating. I want to like it more than I do. The EMUI android user interface/o.s. learning curve continues, it's a pain in the you know what.Over the last 3 weeks I've had trouble sending texts. I've used customer support twice. First time they told me to clear cache and to do so monthly. I did that and it worked trouble free for two weeks. Now back to same problem. 2nd chat support person told me it's my carrier. I will contact carrier, we will see.Lack of hi speed fast charging C cables on market is an issue. Takes forever to charge phone in the car with a non Huawei cable.Transferring data - music, videos, photos has been a challenge. In a nutshell you have to download the HiSuite software from the Huawei site for PCs. Then there was some connectivity issues. I used customer service again. They told me they are having problem with Windows 10, but I'm on Windows 8. I don't know how, but i figured it out on my own. And was able to export videos- I thought i could just drag and drop. So far no. This is a pain.Bottom line- if you have $800 I would probably get the comparable Samsung or Apple.If you are on a budget, then get this, as I did, and expect headaches.On plus side- playing with camera more- night shots are great.A non-techie female's review after 2 weeks of use.After my budget Samsung Galaxy Prime wound up in the washing machine, I made a list of must haves. 1. Unlocked Android for GSM 2. really good camera, quick to open and where you don't have to touch the screen to take the photo.3. good battery 4. expandable memory 5. bigger screen.After researching online I came up with a short list of: Samsung 7 Edge, LG G5, Sony Xperia and Nexus 6 and went to Best Buy to try them out. I eliminated each because the Samsung 7 price, the LG G5 camera was not impressive, the Nexus 6 not impressed and the Sony was not on display. I accidentally saw the Honor 8 displayed and played with it. The camera was amazing. As good as the Samsung 7 with my in store tests. The price was amazing. The screen was superior to the LG and Nexus. That is how I wound up with a phone from a manufacturer I had never heard of. The only thing I sacrificed was a larger screen that I wanted, but it has been fairly easy to enlarge the fonts on various apps, including text messaging, something I do not believe I could do on my Galaxy Prime.Pros: there are many: price for specs, gorgeous screen, camera, battery life, battery charging - seriously goes from 0 to 100% in an hour. I also like the feature that allows a yellow tint to the screen resolution so that it is easier on your eyes. It's not as intrusive as you think and I love it. The fingerprint button on the back can be programmed to do 3 different things in addition to unlocking your phone, for example, holding it down brings up my camera. The camera has endless settings if that is your thing. I really like the pro photo mode and the good food mode. (photos attached). And you can enlarge a photo and the clarity is fantastic.Cons: Two that may or may not be deal breakers for you.1. lack of good accessories, a case is somewhat mandatory based on reviews I read after I purchased it, the back of the phone is glass and slippery when it's placed down. Best Buy had zero accessories. I bought a third party rubbery case on Amazon, which is doing the job for now, but it is not a perfect fit.2. Huawei's Android system - this takes patience, lots of patience. It took me a week before i figured out how to answer a call. A few days before I figured out that I had voice mails waiting for me. I downloaded the 160 page user manual - to figure out how to allow my phone to get emergency alerts- I still haven't figured that out. The user manual does not address everything. Example: on the emergency alert page in your settings, it asks you to enter a CBS channel. I have no clue what this refers to nor is it addressed in the manual.3. C USB charger, it comes with a short one, but you'll need to buy more for the car, etc.The phone is still so new that online user forums are small on info and I've found nothing on it.I do like the 'hidden app' feature (again i don't know if this is Huawei specific as I had a low end Samsung). The hidden apps keeps my home screen relatively clean, but trying to figure out how to alphabetize or move apps around, and in and out of hidden took a lot of trial and error - again there was nothing in the online forums, only questions, no answers. I finally figured out that to unhide an app, you have to go to the last page of your hidden apps and click on ADD app (which seems wrong) but there you uncheck the box of the app you want to unhide so it appears on your main screens.I'm still unsure how to make sure apps aren't open or running in the background as I believe they are and eating into my battery time.Only regret: I got the white and wish I had gotten the Blue which I believe is a Best Buy exclusive.My verdict is this: I got the camera I wanted so for me it's worth it but I'm on a steep learning curve for the proprietary Android OS. if you want a Samsung 7, but at half the price and have the patience and time to really learn Huawei's version of Android, then I recommend this. I will likely never have the time to figure out all the in and outs, but for now I'm glad I got it, but please, please, please someone start making some quality accessories.PS. Huawei is coming out with a larger screen note version of this model - that I'd be interested in!",66.0,4

"LG Optimus GT540 Unlocked GSM Quad-Band Phone with 3 MP Camera, Android OS, Touch Screen, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth--International Version with No US Warranty (Titanium Silver)",LG,65.99,5,"To whoever has been complaining about this product in the past, whichever vendor that was dishonest is no longer associated with this particular page. The phone I bought was shipped by 'Best N Price' and adhered exactly to the description.I was able to slip my SIM card right into the phone, it charged right up, and it functioned properly. So, to be clear, it's fully unlocked and working on the AT&T network as I type. On Android, I was able to upgrade the OS to 2.1 without much trouble -- the updater did the thing where it stops at 4%, which happens with LG phones sometimes, but I was able to restart it without wrecking the phone. The phone is unquestionably durable as well, because I dropped it onto a wood floor the second day I had it and it didn't break. There was no data loss or cracked screen, and the phone worked like normal when I powered it back on.When you're buying this phone, bear a few things in mind; It's a European phone, so it's probably not going to give you a 3G signal -- and, according to some, it may arrive in a Continental language (although I received a UK version). It's also a couple years old, so it's going to have Android 1.6, and the hardware isn't going to be able to handle more than 2.1. Another reviewer here listed the steps to upgrade it to 2.3, but I'm not risking turning it into a paperweight.All in all, you're getting what you pay for with an Android phone in this price range. It was $89.99 when I ordered it, but it looks like the price has shot up. In any case, it's a great deal for that price, but you have no business expecting it to be as capable as a brand new Galaxy or something. In addition, it's a foreign model like many other unlocked phones being sold online, so you ought to be prepared for that eventuality and understand that's part of the reason it's inexpensive.One more thing: have a microSDHC card for the phone, preferably Class 4. It takes up to 32GB (and not microSDXC; too new), and the memory card is needed for many features like downloads and pictures because the phone has very little internal memory. Almost everybody has a microSD card lying around, but be prepared if you don't -- or have a Class 2, since that'll probably be too slow -- because there are plenty of good deals for the high capacity Class 4s on this site.",0.0,4

Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,467.73,5,"When I first held this phone, I had the sudden urge to hum the James Bond theme.The Z5 Compact exudes class. There is no other way to put it. It's hands-down the most premium feeling phone I've held - and that's with it swinging against the big guns such as the S6 Edge, HTC One, and iPhone 6.Cons:-I'm not a huge fan of the frosted back, and think it would have looked better with a normal glass back or just a continuation of the excellent plastic used for the sides. This is largely personal preference though.-The volume rocker is in an extremely awkward position. Unlike the Z3 Compact, you really have to work to use it. Would have been better located above the power button.-It comes in Japanese, and it's very difficult to find the language setting. Pull down the notification bar, then again for settings, click the gear, scroll down to the keyboard, then the top setting.Pros:-The fingerprint sensor/power button is fantastic. It's placed perfectly, works fast, and has just the right feel.-Impeccable fit and finish.-Near stock android.-Design.-Specs.-Camera button, which is sadly a dying feature. The quick-launch ability alone makes it worth having.",9.0,4

I am used to getting phones that have only 8 or 16 GB but I have more than half of the space remaining on my phone and I have numerous apps, pictures, and music downloaded that I use. This phone is an unlocked phone and I was able to successfully add it to my existing Straight Talk service to replace an older phone that was broken. The service on the phone is great. The picture quality is better than the older Galaxy S5 that I previously had. There is a very crisp picture and video.

Nokia 3710 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera and GPS--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black),Nokia,269.1,4,"If you are looking for a reliable phone that makes great quality calls, has good battery life and is reasonably-priced then this is the phone for you.It's very easy to use, nice and small and is GSM so works in Europe too.The USB cable it NOT included, which is a bit of a downside.Don't get too excited about the GPS - it's good in that it works without a data plan but it does take around 5 minutes to load and you do really need a micro SD card to store the maps. This is never going to replace an actual GPS or Google Maps on an Iphone, but if you're not expecting it to do that then it's a nice little feature.I switched to this from the LG Renoir, which has an 8 megapixel camera, WIFI etc etc but absolutely terrible call quality and was not at all user-friendly and am very happy with the switch.",3.0,4

"ASUS ZenFone 2 Unlocked Cellphone, 64GB, Black (U.S. Warranty)",Asus,235.16,3,"I returned the phone and here are the reason why:1. I had read the review about how it would lost wifi connect very often, but bought the way anyway. Over a couple of day of uses the connection issue became more and more annoying. That is one of the biggest reason for me to returned the phone.2. Another problem with this phone is that it is still using the older version of android which cant adapt to the new feature of certain app such as snapchat.3. I had done research, comparing this phone to the one plus two (the plus two is better), on multitask performent. This phone is much worst than expected when it come to multitasking. My apps would restart upon switching to other tasks and thats is really bad for 4gb of ram.The good thing about it:Well the camera is amazing, the display is beautiful, and the fast charge is the best. The high speed connection might be another if it wasn't for the disconnections.I thought about it and finally decided to pay a little more for the one plus two so I get a phone with more solid performance",0.0,4

BLU Studio G LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Black,BLU,109.99,5,"declaration: I bought this phone with my money for my use. The following is only my own opinions and experiences.This phone got a 5 star by comparing its value and the product. I am an iPhone fan, but lately carrying an iPhone is not that glamorous like old days because everybody has it. Also in whatever cost analysis case, I am spending an average of $25 every month for an iPhone, but this one or something like this one costs my only $9 a month. Then when we come back to the very purpose of a phone; like calling, checking the email, weather etc. this phone is an excellent choice. I bought this android phone just to understand why there is so many android fans, and this is pretty much the first android I am using and checking its user friendliness.(I bought another BLU phone last week""Studio 7.0 LTE - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Grey"", but returned it because there was some hardware and software glitches, but I am pretty sure that was a rare case. I liked that phone!!!! superfast, clear and crisp. Wow!!!)Pros:1.lollipop 5.12.costs only $100.00, come on!!!! a smartphone at this price!!!3.decent call quality4.almost all the major functions of an iPhone5. availability of weather, battery, widgets and numerous apps which is not available in an iphone6. decent speed of the processor.7. Freedom of many, many useful apps which is not available in iOS8. Great battery life- it might last 2 full days on a single charge based on my present experience of medium uaage[ my iphone 5s has to charge 4 times if I use like that [2 times a day],9. I like the email app- it is beautiful , better than iOS, also availability of blue mail(it is not available on iOS)10. It comes with a slap on case and screen protector- so you are good to go.(I do not need a military grade vault to protect this phone unlike the iphone, because this costs only $100, if something happens I will buy another one]cons:1. The software is not refined as an iOS, so the basic messenger and phone apps are not that user-friendly like an iPhone.[ but you can download tons apps for this, and there is many best apps are available]2. camera is neither fast nor that quality of an iPhone[ anyway I use my alpha 6000 sony for that purpose, not even iphone 6]3. Processor is a hair slow, what I meant is it is not lightning fast like a latest iPhone( I could say it is fast like a iPhone 3G)4.. unknown longevity, but this phone costs only a 1/6th of an iphone. [My iPhone 4S is already past 3 years, it is like an asset handed down to generations- it survived two toddlers and still running strong, may be another 2 more years?).SO it looks like my 5S is getting some rest and I am going to use this until I am bored of this.",5.0,4

The PPI is close to what is on the iPad Pro 9.7"" so I don't get why people don't like the screen; it's basically retina display. The price is what got me to get this phone. I don't feel comfortable buying a $650+ IPhone or $400+ Android phone when under $120 can get you a dual sim, expandable storage, and great experience.

The ""owners manual"" is one sheet of paper and it starts off with the premise that the ""as delivered"" configuration of the phone need not be explained or instructions need not be provided. hence the phone would only remain ""on"" for a few seconds and then promptly shut down. being ""new "" to Android environment made my situation worse. I did reach ""tech support"" of my cell carrier who markets this phone hoping for some on-line assistance. The person told me I could clear any settings and put the phone in ""OEM"" baseline configuration by a simultaneous manipulation of the power key and some other key which I cannot recall. Doing this did not re-boot the phone as promised - but rather caused the screen to rapidly flash on and off - over and over.

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,292.99,2,"The phone is nice. It really is. Decent speed, huge display with great quality. Though the camera is 13 megapixels, it suffers from being really bad in low light situations. But it's a phone camera and I'm buying a phone for phone functionality, not for its camera. Battery lasts an entire day from moderate usage which is an arbitrary term, but I keep a battery pack on me just in case. Size is immense but thin. Won't fit in your pocket without changing how you walk. I knew this would be a factor when I bought the phone, not that big of a deal since I carry my phones in my vest pocket. For the price, it's quite nice.On the other hand, there is a glaring problem that happens on an almost regular basis with the headphone jack. I'll be playing music or a podcast and the sound will get staticky for a moment and then mute completely. After a random amount of time it'll resume playback at the point where it went out. Sometimes it happens once in awhile, but lately it's been just on and off and on and off incessantly. My 1 hour podcasts turn into 2 hours with all the cutting in and out. This does not happen when I'm doing Skype and phone calls while plugged in for some strange reason. One thing that seems to be working to alleviate the problem is simply using the phone while using the headphone jack to listen to audio. Once the screen goes to sleep, it starts happening again.I contacted BLU support and initially I was under the impression that it was a human responding to me, but after I was told to reset my app settings and hard reset my phone which worked only temporarily, I started getting in a message loop with who---or whatever was helping me out. They suggest hard reset, I told them I did that a month ago. They suggest hard reset again copy/pasting the previous message, I copy/paste my explanation that I already did it. Back and forth. All I wanted to do is just let them know that this sounds like a firmware issue that they should report to their dev team to resolve on their end, because none of their solutions are working and there is nothing to show that it's a physical issue with the headphone jack itself. But still, it's the same thing back and forth.Like I said. Great phone. But I've seen other people have problems with the headphone jack. I've been starting to carry my old MP3 player around to listen to audio instead. Given this issue and the bad customer service experience I think I'll be looking at other brands for my next phone, even if it means sizing down on the features.***EDIT*** If anyone has solutions for the audio problem, leave a comment on this review.

I would buy it. Until then, I continue to use this, waiting for another one that is at least as good, overall.I don't expect anybody to agree with me... phones these days have so many features and characteristics, and people's preferences vary so widely; plus individual preferences change constantly.But some of the things that keep this being the phone I use everyday, instead of the newer and more powerful nexus 4, samsung s6, moto G, LG OptimusG, and all the other flagcrap out there... which i peruse weekly: I like that the bottom buttons are touch buttons not the mechanical ones found on the iPhone and Samsung ones that have come out since this one, that I can use a Call Recorder on this...so many don't allow that now without rooting, that the UI is pleasantly colorful and visually easy to use unlike the cave-painting concept of especially the newer bare-Android yet not as garish/ridiculous/animated as the one's on the flagSamsungs, that they don't lie about the size of the screen by including the touch buttons in the screen, that it is a good size for the hand, that it is still workably powerful after almost four years, in short... that it was/is high-Function, Low bs.I wish I could remember all the specific times I have gotten this to do things that were no longer sexy enough to show up in the newest and greatest flagships, but that I still wanted to be able to access on my phone, sexy or not.In short, this was a winner, a sleeper, but a winner.Of course there are things I don't like about this, but they are all minor compared to the deal-breakers that show up on all the flagships currently out there, and for the last 3 years.Unfortunately it is like looking for the holy grail now to get a phone that fits in only one hand, and yet is flagship-powerful. So at some point I suppose I will be forced to buy one of the humongoids, and the handtruck it fits on, just so I can still download modern webpages.I'm ready even for that, if they would only make one that would do all that this one did four years ago, and is still doing.

Another consumer (I think) pointed out that it uses a different network than Verizon and that I should have done my research. Well, maybe I should have. But I don't know, I'm a consumer, and even though I agree that consumers should indeed do their homework, the majority will read ""Super Cool Quad Band Watch"". And since there is no disclaimer in the specifications, most would probably buy it. I mean I'm not an expert, but how many people really know what GSM or CMDA means? If the Verizon guy couldn't figure it out......Anyway, I bought this product, took it to my cell phone carrier (Verizon) and they could not get it to work. Because I am not willing or able to search all of the cell phone carriers to find out which one can get it to work, and because of the fact that it is way more bulkier than I thought, I returned it.You know what, in all fairness, I'll upgrade my rating because I can't speak on how it works. But I got a white one and the watch band is a noticeable different shade of white compared to the watch.

So when I did my search and found that you can sideload some android apps on a BlackBerry, it was a no brainer for me.The phone arrived on time, nicely put together. In the box came a shiny new phone, data cable, a couple of ""international"" socket converters, and even handsfree set. But to be honest the ear pieces are weird so I haven't used them yet.I simply took out the sim card from my android t-mobile phone, plugged that in, as well as my micro SD card, put in the batter, plugged it, and turned it on. It booted just fine.Since I came in from Android, I gave it about 45 minutes or so to complete downloading my contacts, emails, and calendar.I didn't have to download ANYTHING, the native email and calendar apps are very good, and they sync up really well with the google account.I honestly think this phone is the best of both worlds, you can navigate via the touch screen, and use the awesome keyboard to type what it is you need to type. And believe it or not, have a physical keyboard actually allows me to make MUCH less typos on my messages.And you can easily switch back and forth between the two languages using the ""alt+enter"" keystrokes on the keyboard.ALSO: the word recommendation feature is turned OFF by default, you just have to navigate your way through the settings to turn it on, and while your there, you can create some keyboard short-cuts to commonly used sentences.i.e. I have set up that if I type ""cul"" the option ""See You Later"" would pop up!

Second, the sound level from the ear piece was very low in comparison to the Moto G. Possibly defective? Probably not because the external speaker volume was also much lower than the Moto G. Lastly, I was surprised to find the 4G was not much faster than the Moto G 3G on data downloads. Maybe I was expecting too much but I don't think its worth $250 to upgrade from the Moto G.",7.0,3

CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Silver),,59.99,2,"The watch arrived on time and as promised so I am extremely happy about that.However....the watch itself isn't a bad design. It really is solid in feel but the problem(s) are as follows.1. The watch lags and freezes.2. The touch screen does not respond all the time.3. The speaker volume does not have a high enough setting to allow you to hear unless the place you are at is quiet.4. The earpiece supplied with the watch is just as bad.For me, I don't care about the other functions, because my main focus was on the phone only. Overall, it made and received calls just fine without dropping them and I would be happy to keep this item if the speaker had a higher volume level and the UI was just a tiny bit more responsive.A good watch at $40, but for my needs I'll pay a little more for a better speaker.",0.0,3

Nokia N9 Unlocked GSM Phone with 64 GB Internal Memory--International Version (Black),Nokia,228.88,4,"First of all, the hardware is gorgeous. It's the best looking phone I've ever seen, really. The beveled glass is stunning, it's so sleek and minimalistic.The guts are just a little last generation. Just a little. Single core, which does pretty good all things considered. The back camera is pretty good, but not great. The front camera is exactly what you'd expect from a camera. The headset speaker is awful, and the conference speaker is just ok. From what people tell me, the mic is pretty good though, and it filters out a good bit of background noise. The 64g storage is great.Meego OS is absolutely awesome. I love the OS itself. Innovative, smooth, lots of fun and easy to use. The settings grouped a little odd, but you get used to it. The built-in music app is really good (and plays FLAC out of the box!), the built-in video player is awful. The built-in video player is really picky, and won't play a lot of usual videos (mostly screen resolution issues, I think).Now, the real drawback - the apps. Not much out there. There are some apps, and a handful of those are really good. Most of the good ones are paid-only, and more likely than not it's going to be more than .99 cents. I'm fine with that (I'll gladly pay for a good app), but coming from Android or iOS people are going to be surprised.I found enough apps to cover everything I absolutely needed, so I'm good. App addicts are not going to like it, for sure. Social media is relatively well covered here. Skype has chat and calls, but no video calls (real bummer). It had Google's Video Chat, until Google changed the API to try to force people into signing up for their social media site. Sigh. Now Google Video Chat sort of works, sometimes, and usually only when someone calls you with it. The biggest bummer for my purposes is the lack of a really good podcatching app. There are three in the store - 2 don't work and one works... Mostly... But it's missing a lot of the niceties that even an app on my Blackberry 8320 had 7 years ago.All in all, I absolutely love this phone and I am not sorry I bought it. I plan on using it until it dies. It's such a breath of fresh air from the other two platforms. But, because it's a dead OS, it most certainly isn't going to be for everyone.",,2
Nokia 2730 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2 MP Camera (Black),Nokia,269.1,5,"Pros: Price ($90). Decent audio quality. Good reception. Bright, high resolution screen (small, however), the GPS map software actually works. (But it needs extra hardware. See below. Voice recorder and camera are functional. Does not come with the AT&T ringtone/startup sound.Cons: Battery life is short. Does get quite warm. Does not support large memory cards (I read 4GB max. I'm using a 2GB card). It's not an iphone. I would not dream of using this to browse the web or send email. Calendar has a loud irritating alert sound.I've had it for 5 months. It works perfectly for what I wanted. It is incomparably better than the chintzy samsung freebie I had before. As for the GPS, the maps are stored offline, so the GPS feature does not require an expensive data plan.

I suggest buy them here they are much cheaper if you are going with H2O.The only drawbacks I have found are the following, The battery life is short I am lucky to make it a day. I suggest buying a second or third battery right away. They are cheap $14 gets you two.The second it doesn't seem to switch wifi hotspots all that well. I seem to have to enable and disable it when I go from place to place, not a huge deal takes literally 5 seconds.

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Grey,BLU,129.99,4,"Review for BLU PURE XL SmartphoneArrived in 2 days using amazon prime. Boxed well and arrived intact.This is a good value smart phone that does 95% of what people will want and does it well. The 5% that may not be served well by this device are the hardcore users that truly make use of the CPU power regularly. If you are in the 5% then spend twice as much and get the Samsung note5 or some similar phone.Pro:Price = Good value based on specsSize = Wonderful, easy enough to hold and use. If I manage to get it in a shirt pocket it sticks out and looks funny.Screen = Wow, great definition. Netflix looks good. Almost too much resolution/dpi to appreciate at this size. Reviews show that this screen is not as bright as many devices at twice the priceâ¦â¦they are correct but I still find it good for my needs. I have not tried to use it on a bright sunlit beach.Speed = Fairly quick. Fastest phone I have used. Rated at about 70% of the speed of the Samsung note5 at half the price.Battery recharge time: Fast with correct charger. 2hrs or less.Does all the things you would expect from a smart phone.Con:Size : If I manage to get it in a shirt pocket it sticks out and looks funny. I love the size but is hard to store. I put it in my back pack most of the time. Fits snuggly in my front pants pocket.Battery: â¦.. almost a deal breaker. If you use this as a phone primarily you should be ok, but if you use apps a lot then could be an issue. Here is my experience. Opened box, put phone on charger, arrives with 86% charge, charges to 100% in about 20 minutes or so. I start it up, install Google play account, download and install 2 items. One of them is a game that is cpu intensiveâ¦â¦.I start it and let it run unattended for 1.5hrs. After 1.5hours the battery goes from 100% to 20%. I fully recharge it again and do the same test with similar results. I will keep my eye on this to see if subsequent recharges help it to hold a charge for longer. This has forced me to keep a charger with the phone as it needs recharging by noon. I recommend getting fast usb rechargers for work and home. The wall charger that comes with the phone is good, but I also have a usb battery chargerâ¦.30000mah.CPU: Great bang for the buck, but it gets hot and runs the battery dead fast if you put this beast to its limits.Buttons along bottom: The back button is really hard to find. Sometimes it feels as if it is disabled as I slide my finger across the the whole bottom surface and nothing...then it starts working. This issue is the most annoying about this device....though the battery is a concern also.Over all I do not regret this purchase as I cannot afford what I want so I am happy with what I can get.",2.0,0

So... if you're not very tech savvy but want the 4G/LTE, maybe skip this one; and if anyone has figured out how to connect to the high speed internet, please respond to this review and you'll be forever appreciated!",0.0,0

To tell you just how tough this phone is, it flew off my car at 75 miles per hour without a case on it and only the screen protector. Then sat on the side of the highway for a week during a 100 degree heat wave. When I got it back there was only a scratch on the back and the screen was COMPLETELY fine.

Apple iPhone 4 Black Smartphone 32GB (AT&T),,135.0,5,"As these iPhones progress they just keep getting better and better. If you have had an earlier iPhone you will be able to work this one as well. The nice thing about apple is when they make their next gen. of phone you don't have to relearn the hole phone again. The new phone will run just like the older one but with more kool and better stuf. I compare it to driving a Toyota. If you drive a camery, and upgrade it to a newer model the new one is still set up inside just like the old one but with nicer stuf.I started out with Apple using the iPod touch. Loving it I figured I'd try the iPhone. Well I love it too. It is so user friendly and easy to navigate that it is a no brainer of most everything. But at the same time the iPhone is full of very useful things. It is really a pocket computer. To put it simply.If you are a real computer tech, it may not have some of the things that the droid has, but you don't have to spend a month or more to learn the thing either.If you have any other Apple mobile product and you like it, you will love the iPhone as well.",1.0,4

Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini G800F 16GB 4G LTE Unlocked GSM Android Quad-Core Smartphone - Blue,,489.0,5,"This phone is wonderful. It has fast WiFi speeds and good mobile data speeds. On T-Mobile in US I only get H+, H, 3G, E and G. If I'm lucky I can get 4G sometimes. This phone is the International Version so some LTE bands won't work for US. The camera on this phone is great. If I hold the phone still when I take the picture then it would turn out really well. Though this phone has a fingerprint sensor, it sometimes doesn't register the fingerprint and after a while I give up and put in my alternative password. The touchscreen is great and responds really well. Out of the box it is running Android 4.4.2 KitKat which is really fast. On certain apps the phone crashes and restarts or it just freezes and you have to take the battery out and put it back in. Since this version is the International Version it does have NFC unlike the US Version. Calling is great and you can hear the person you're talking to really clearly. Also in the box it comes with the phone, a battery, earbuds with microphone and volume controls, and a USB Charger that has to long round ports and can only be used internationally.Overall, this is an excellent phone and works really well. If you're looking for a phone that isn't very expensive and can get the job done then this is the phone you're looking for. The screen is not too big and not too small. You can easily use the phone with one hand and reach all four corners. I really recommend this phone!",2.0,4

This is why I no longer buy US variants of phones because carriers are making it more difficult to root and install custom ROM's-Really waterproof-SD expandabiltiy is back, as it should beCons--Edge is kinda annoying if you don't have a case. Your fingers will constantly press the sides of the screen and mess with what you are doing-No 64 or 128GB models for some reason. It's 2016 Samsung, only 32 GB?-Stock Samsung software is always atrocious in my opinion.

It came with a silicone case but I also ordered the case separately from BLU. The hard case with rubbery protective layer will not fit over the jelly case though. It has protected my phone from breaking many times now. This phone is still working great. The only problem I had was with an BLU system update. I contacted them and they were helpful but the only solution left was doing a hard reset. Good thing everything backs up to Google and my SIM card, it made it easy to make it my old phone again.

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 64GB - Sunrise Gold - GSM - US Warranty,,449.99,5,"So far so good. I am coming from a Nexus 5 and needed an upgrade. I tried the Pixel and it was an amazing phone, loved the simplicity of Google phones but not the price. I ended up returning it because I couldn't bring myself to spending $850 on a phone, which brought me here. Was going to buy last years Nexus 6P but I read that Huawei came up with a better and newer phone this year.After reading review after review, the consensus has been good battery, good camera, fast, and unfortunately a bad OS. I was really worried because I have grown really fond of plain android over the last 3 years but the cyber sale was too good to pass up. When I got the phone, I was immediately turned off by the lack of an app drawer so after about 30 mins with the phone I downloaded the Google Now launcher and all was well!!! I also downloaded all of the standard google apps (gmail, photos, messanger, calander, keep, clock...) while uninstalling as much of the bloat as possible (good thing Honor comes pretty bare). I read up on the net about all of the buried settings to enable/disable apps from running in the background while off. Now the phone runs great, and I can barely tell its a not plain android, except the notification setting pull down as it takes some getting used to.This phone is very fast and has a great camera, not as good as the pixel but it was about 500$ less I think I can live with it! The fingerprint sensor is crazy fast and I love that you can set it up as a shortcut for different tasks, especially because the power and volume being on the same side of the phone made taking screenshots one handed very difficult. Now I can set my fingerprint double tap to take care of that.Time will tell if this phone holds up, I'm still concerned about the possibility of not getting security updates or OS updates but we'll see. For now I am happy about my purchase. If anyone is reading this and is on the fence, just do it!!!",4.0,4

A full charge does not even last for 6 hours (without data usage or calls). I checked the same model's performance with my friends and found it to be satisfactory.

I only got my hands on it this week but it arrived where it was supposed to by the estimated delivery date. Since I've been playing around with the phone, it's not hard to use at all. I love the sleek look of it. It's thin but not so thin that I'm afraid to handle it.The display is so crisp and clear, it's beautiful. I also like that it comes with headphones, a case and a screen protector in the box. The case isn't a very thick case, it won't offer much protection from drops, but it's nice to have anyway, it can still protect the phone from scratches.In terms of apps, I love that it comes with Google Play already loaded on it because I'm not sure that I would have been able to get it through Google, due to where I live.Finally, I'm very glad that the battery is a removable battery because I don't really trust those non removable types. Also, it's a pretty large battery in my opinion and I think the battery life is really nice, especially since I downloaded Battery Doctor app. I can get through the whole day with the phone and not be worried that it's going to give out on me.My only concern is, I'm not sure how to turn on Bluetooth... I thought it would have been a simple matter of going into Settings but I haven't come across it yet. I'll have to read around and see what I can find. But overall, this phone is worth the money and the 5 star rating in my opinion.",0.0,0

"Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900A GSM Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Blue",samsung,172.0,1,"Worst Online experience so far.I thought I did an extensive research before my purchase. I guess I didnt. I have had my phone for 6 months only and I regret this purchase.For starters it comes with several at&t apps and widgets that took me a while to know how to uninstall and disable, and they used my battery and my data. (I guess that's just ignorance from my side)Then with a silly fall the screen cracked pretty bad, and replacing it was expensive.The charger got damaged pretty fast, I was surprised by this. It was supposed to be original right?The battery also got damaged and became unusable. I was told this should not happen with this thpe of phone so fast, meaning one thing. The battery was not original. They check my charger and guess what. It was not originall either. The outlet piece should handle 5.3V and it just handles 5.0v which apparently makes a big difference and could have been another reason why the fake battery got ruined fast.Anyways, after this experience I am not buying from this seller and I would probably buy to a company which gives a better warranty (more than a month) if I make an online purchase.",2.0,0
CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Gold Plus),CNPGD,59.99,4,"Just received this watch yesterday and got it all set up. I really enjoy the look and feel of the watch. I do not find the size of the watch, at least as of yet, to be too large. It does not impinge my movement at it is very light, can hardly even tell I'm wearing it. The band is very comfortable and has plenty of different wrist size variability.As for the set up, make sure to scan the bar code that is programmed into the watch before pairing with bluetooth. I made this mistake last night and was confused as to why the BT notifier wasn't pairing. So turn on the watch, scan the barcode, download the app on your phone, and then pair the phone and watch through bluetooth. Once you do that I have gotten the phone calls, texting, and camera to work.One thing right off the bat I'm really disappointed about for this watch is the fact that I can't change the clock interface or the background color of the home screen. It's really not the end of the world, but I feel like this shouldn't be too difficult just to allow users to change. Oh well though.I did try to use the sleep monitor last night and it told me I slept poorly, but I don't believe I did! Something to play with more! I agree that the pedometer probably isn't the most accurate. I am looking forward to get an extra micro card for memory and to put music on this watch. I will hopefully be using it to go on runs and not have to bring my phone.Over all I definitely feel like for the cheap price of this watch I'm allowed to really see if I like this smart watch business.",2.0,4

I used to have the color white, so I purchased the gold. I am not a techy person so I wont go too much into detail. The only negative things I have to say about the Note 5 is the obvious lack of expandable storage and removable battery, but Samsung announced they will be bringing it back. However, I am okay with the storage amount on this device.I was a little nervous about purchasing a phone on Amazon, especially an international version. I was not sure of the difference but I do not notice anything. Everything arrived safely and on time. The phone arrived in an original Samsung box with the Samsung headphones and a UK style Samsung wall adapter. I was concerned over this, but after double-checking the box, the seller supplied me with a U.S. adapter. This was awesome because my phone still recognized it was a fast travel charger, even with the adapter. I used to have a TMobile Note 4 with a StraightTalk micro sim. The Note 5 is nano size, so I had to purchase a new one. Transferring my number was an easy process that only lasted a few hours, which is normal. The SM-N920C (Note 5) is 4G LTE capable. I was panicking at first because it only said 4G on the status bar, but it is just cosmetic. It is 4G LTE, but it says 4G. The phone is fast with and without wifi.I love the Galaxy Note models because of the S Pen. On the Note 4, you just pull the S Pen out but on this model, you have to push it in to get it out. It is a little new for me, but it is not something I cant get used to. The functionality of the S Pen is excellent. It also looks really nice.There is no lagging on the Note 5. Everything processes smoothly. I am such a big fan of Samsung and I am amazed by all of the things this device can do. I am a college student and it just helps me with my daily tasks and I also love to stream videos and music. I can tell you the Note 5 screen looks way better on the Note 5 than the Note 4. The Note 4 is a great phone, but if you have the chance to upgrade, do it!I know most of my review was a comparison between Note 4 and 5 but I was trying to give as much detail as possible :) comment if you have any questions.",17.0,4

"Samsung Galaxy J7 SM- J700H/DS GSM Smartphone-Android 5.1- 5.5"" AMOLED Display- International Version (Black)",Samsung,208.0,5,"This is an AMAZING phone. When I bought it, my mom almost didn't let me, because she thought since it was so low priced, it would be bad. DO NOTE, THAT THE SELLER IS RAISING THE PRICE, AND I BOUGHT MINE FOR $204 ABOUT A WEEK AGO. NOW IT WAS $245.So I am saying, if the price goes down, GO FOR IT.There are two SIM card slots, so you can add extra memory, and not worry about having not enough space.Imagine.. 128GB of storage space.. The possibilities are ENDLESS!Also, the processing speed is flawless, you can play games on there as well as any other.The camera works well, if you are expecting a g7x camera in a phone then that's your problem. It's just a phone.But a REALLY great thing about this phone- it has front camera flash! Amazing! A Samsung Galaxy s5 doesn't even have that.It comes with 16GB memory, which is excellent for a phone, you can actually do stuff.Another good thing-This phone doesn't load you up on extra apps, only one page! it does come with a folder with Microsoft word, PowerPoint, etc. but that can just be deleted. I'm talking about undeletable apps.TO ALL YOU T-MOBILE USERS, YES! IT WORKS WITH T-MOBILE!you can use 4G LTE or 4G with T-Mobile and you can use data outside, and make calls, texts, etc.This is a fully functioning phone.It is almost as big as a Samsung Galaxy note 4 , only smaller by about a centimeter, and it's as a big as an iPhone 6+. Ayye.The screen is amazingly clear, and the brightness is phenomenal.The sound quality is really good, and unless you want to blast music around the entire city, the sound volume suffices.The RAM is 1.5GB, which is really good for a $204 phone.The phone doesn't heat up at all, and it maintains a steady room temperature, no matter how much you used it.When my phone arrived, it was definitely new. It had never been opened, and there was still plastic protectors on the screen and on the side. Not a smudge.The battery was wrapped up nicely out of the phone, and it came with 50 percent charge in it. This lasted me all day!It DID come with a charger and earbuds, but the charger was universal. ITS OKAY THOUGH , because it came with a peice to match the wall sockets. This could be seen as a plus, though, because this means that you can use this charger around the world. You can also use the phone itself around the world, too since its international!The earbuds came a little wonky.. One earbud chord size was was much to short, but it's okay, because it was generous to even include earbuds in the first place.OOOH OOH AND THE THEMES!!!YES!!!They're amazing! You can use themes to change the ENTIRE look of your phone. It changes the font, the s Rene color and pattern, and even the looks of the applications and. Decorates the insides of the apps. The keyboards could look different, and you could have clouds instead of chat bubbles in the messaging app, with a tebddy bear pink background. Ooh.There are also MANY themes for free. They do have payed ones, but you can find NO problem at all finding ten really cute free themes.This phone does work in America!Have FUN with this phone.This phone really is unlocked, so you can use any carrier.Go buy this phone now, and have no doubts in your head, because it is AMAZING.-Pictures attachedP.S I lost the black part for the charger that turns it into a normal charger but yes, it does come with one.

Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Phone with Dual-Band GSM 850/1900--International Version with No Warranty (Black),Motorola,63.28,1,"I mistakenly bought this international version to use in the US. So at first I had to change the language settings to English and search for an English manual online. This is a very basic phone, but so basic that I thought it went back to the early days of cell phone development. First, all your contacts on your sim card don't transfer neatly into the phone, the names are all messed up with upper case and lower case making it hard to read. The phone book is not very easy to use either. Then I don't even know what all the random number that shows up, is it a date? time? code? I don't even know how to reset the date and time. And the design and feel of the phone looks like a toy phone which we don't mind so much if it works. We don't use the text message feature on there so it doesn't matter if it has it, but if you buy it because there's a text message feature I don't know you should because it's so primitive. We also have a hard time figuring out the call history so if we missed a phone call we really missed it and wouldn't know who called us last. We gave up figuring out the phone and so we are buying another phone.",0.0,0

I check my phone, and if there are no texts it's too much trouble to check social media ""real quick"".However, the one thing I could not live without was threaded, conversation-style messaging. The phone that I had previously only had the typical ""inbox"" and ""sent box"" arranged by time. As such, it's difficult to juggle conversations with multiple ladies, and I quickly found myself in trouble.Imagine my horror when I found that almost every feature phone in existence lacked a threaded messaging feature! I barely escaped with all of my parts the last time around, and was resolved to never go through that again.After checking several hundred models, I found this phone. Battery life is great, and messaging is threaded, as well easy and quick with a nice full keyboard. The keyboard feels quite nice, especially considering the price (and I used to own Nokia and Blackberry full keyboard smartphones). The only downside is that the processor is underpowered for this OS. It occasionally freezes and will lag several words behind you while texting. If you text when talking on the phone, the audio skips slightly every time you hit a button.Those issues aside, it is a functional phone with a build quality that surpasses the price I paid for it.

My contract was up with Verizon and I could have gotten the new version of this "" The Convoy 2"", but they wanted $150 for it and have me sign a new contract. But when I saw this one for around $30 in perfect condition I snapped it up. The only complaint I have about it would be that it doesn't use the ""micro USB"" like most phones are using now a days.

Verizon Motorola RAZR V3m GPS 3G Camera Cell Phone - Silver,Motorola,13.33,1,"I purchased this phone in hopes of replacing my old razr from Verizon. I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new.I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network.$80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.",12.0,4

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Factory Unlocked Phone 32 GB - International Version G935F- Platinum Gold,,594.89,5,"I received this phone yesterday and instantly fell in love with it. I have owned several Galaxy phones (s3, s4, s4 active, and s5). So far I love it! It came sealed in the original box. I cannot use the charger adapter that came with it, but I expected that as it's an international version.I picked the gold color, it looks and feels elegant and sleek. I love the interface, the phone itself is super fast. The phone has a big, beautifully bright screen. I am still getting used to its size. The fingerprint scanner is noticeably better than that of the gs5. Both cameras take amazing pictures.I am one of those people that are constantly on their phones during most of the day. It has an excellent battery life and charges very fast.I did read a couple reviews where people complained about the phone slipping out of their hands. I have used an Otterbox Symmetry Series case since I took it out of the box and have not had that problem at all.My only complaint about this phone is that it does not have an IR blaster, but I can live with that.I will update my review in the future if anything changes.UPDATE:I have been using this phone for about a month now and it is still just as amazing as when I took it out of the box. It still has amazing battery life. I have a Pocket Juice power bank that I was using around noon every day with my Gs5 but I have not used it at all with this phone. It usually still has 15% after about 12 hours of use.I have not had any lagging or random restarts like I did with my Gs5. The phone is still amazingly fast and responsive.I have slightly tested the waterproofing of this phone. The fingerprint scanner does not work well when wet, but the touch screen is still responsive.I have a Otterbox Symmetry Series case that I use with this phone and I have noticed that it causes the Zagg Dry screen protector to bubble up around the edges (I would like to state that I did NOT allow the protector 24 hours to ""cure"" after applying before putting the case back on, so that could be the reason.) I have heard that with the edges it is hard to find a case/screen protector combination that doesn't cause bubbling at the edges.Overall I would definitely recommend this phone.",1.0,4

I used a Nexus 5 previously and it feels like the perfect maximum size for a one handed use. I'm 5'10"" and have fairly large hands.This phone is still big for one handed use. I find that the extra sized bezel at the bottom made it difficult to use the onscreen keyboard comfortably with a single hand. I was able to use keyboard perfectly on a Nexus 5 with one hand.

It looks really really good. Got compliments from people.It's so nice to hold it in my hand. The size is just perfect for me. Every time I touch the screen, it feels awesome! Rounded edges is a big plus.Performance is solid and free of lagging. 32GB storage is okay, but you get much less of free space. 3GB of RAM is good.Fingerprint sensor is a very useful thing. However, you will have to install a firmware from another region to enable it (do it on your own fear and risk! I do not recommend you to do this). They locked the sensor in US version as you may already know.What else to say? Camera is okay. I was not able to test it a lot, as I don't care that much about camera, but it's definitely nice to have 13mp frontal camera. Flash light of the rear camera is stronger that was on Z2. I use bank app to deposit checks and it's hard to take a good picture of check when you don't have enough light around. Flash is strong and it makes checks too light and hard to read.Reception is good. Nice to finally have band 12, it really helps with T-Mobile. Wi-Fi connection is solid and didn't give me any headaches.Battery could have been better. Have to charge everyday. Might be something with Android Marshmallow? I remember I had pretty long battery life on Z2 with Lollipop. After update to MM, battery life significantly reduced and I had to charge it everyday (every 2nd or even 3rd day on lollipop).--------------------------------------P.S.

Plum Ram - Unlocked Rugged Phone - Tough Durable IP67 - Water Shock Proof GSM (Black),Plum,49.99,1,"I don't recommend this phone. It is not waterproof. Why spend $89 on a phone that fills up with water. Actually, it is waterproof out in, that is, the water goes inside the phone, floods the screen, I mean filled with water, but does not go out. I slipped into the pool with the phone in my pocket. The phone stayed under water less than 5 seconds. I immediately took it out of my pocket as I had very precious stuff stored in there. It filled with water instantly, visible between the screen and the rubber cover. It's dead. This phone is not what it claims to be. There are other problems with this phone. The flash light turns on while the keypad is locked, thus in the pocket and drains the battery out. The mp3 player only allows for 1 playlist, the default one. Once the phone is in the ""mass file"" mode, it cannot switch to the regular phone mode, meaning you have to turn it off and back on. The phone may go dead when the off switch is pressed, forcing to remove the battery, back in, and start the entire phone set up again (date, options...). It is not a good phone, not the German quality, and certainly not worth its price. Oh, one more thing. I bought the phone 6 months ago, supposedly with a 1 year warranty... It seems I can't get it serviced or replaced. Nobody there to answer.This is what I had written earlier. It was wrong.I'm pleased with this phone. It is rugged, and that's what I wanted. I threw it on the floor thinking it might bounce back into my hand. Well, it didn't, it's not a ball, but it did not break. It is truly waterproof, dust proof, and it is a phone, not a pocket computer. That's important to me, because I still was trying to figure out how to hold my smartphone after 3 months, upside or downside, how to use my contacts list on the fly... and so on. My smartphone fell out of my shirt pocket into the lake... gone, but no regret. The hell with smartphones! I already have 2 computers and had no need for another one.The phone is light, 140 grams, It's half the size of a smartphone; much lighter and it holds in my pocket without bulging. That's what a phone is supposed to be like in my mind. No more special case around my belt as was the case with my smartphone.This PLUM is not a smartphone, but with 64MB + 32MB RAM, it is smart enough. I downloaded all of my music from my computer using BlueTooth onto my 32GB SD card (not included). It took me a good 2 hours. The sound coming from the earphones is good; but it doesn't blast to make me deaf, which is no more than I want. I connected it to my car stereo, which detected it immediately. My preferred Rock'n Roll hits sounded absolutely fantastic. The FM sound is decent. The over the phone voices are clear. The recorder is what I need.The 1280 x 1024 camera resolution is good enough quality for what I want to do with it. When I want to film, I tend to use a camera rather than a phone.I haven't gone through all the functions yet. But, from what I saw and tested so far, it is what I had hoped for, exactly.Delivery was much faster than announced - 12 days announced, versus 5 days actual delivery time. .Yes, I recommend this phone for those who want a rugged phone with a decent multimedia capability.",43.0,4

Sony Xperia Z5 Premium E6853 5.5-Inch 4K UHD Display Factory Unlocked (GOLD) - International Stock No Warranty,Samsung,472.49,1,"This is not a good phone as far as running application and taking photos, and the battery life is excellent. But damn this thing is brittle, I don't put cases on my phones which was a huge mistake with this phone.I have had this phone for 3 months and already with normal wear and tear there are multiple visible scratches on the back and one on the glass on front of the phone. I have no idea how it got any of these scratches and non of my previous phones ever got a scratch on the glass. So now I don't know if it is waterproof as I don't know how deep the scratches go, and waterproof was a main quality when picking this phone.Also the Bluetooth is very sporadic when hooking to my car sometimes it works flawlessly other times I have to turn off the Bluetooth and turn it back on and resync with my car. Sometimes i have to do this multiple times. my previous phone didn't have this problem, the worse part about this is that it will play the audio through the phone which is muted so my audio books are playing in the background without me realizing it.There is also a Phantom touch that occurs on the top left randomly. so the menu on top will drop and raise and drop and raise. This is usually fixed by rubbing the top left of the phone but still annoying.The fingerprint scanner works about 40% of the time for no apparent reason.And the double tap to view screen is severely broken. This is the feature where double tapping the screen performs the same action as the power button. I had to disable this feature as it being in my pocket would randomly turn on the screen and just mash the dial buttons.On the plus side, it runs applications fairly well when I don't get the phantom touching going on and it hasn't butt dialed the cops yet. This is my first Sony phone and I probably will not be getting another one. Again this is all the things I have experienced in just 3 short months.",0.0,0

Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - White - 64GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,298.95,1,I was in love with this phone until yesterday which was October 28th 2016. I receive the phone October 14th 2016. This phone is excellent as long as it has no bugs in it. What ended up happening is that the phone started flipping from screen to screen and it becomes uncontrollable and is extremely difficult to power down when it is in that mode. It is extremely frustrating and I cannot recommend this phone to anyone. I have not called the manufacturer to utilize and warranty since I am within the 30 days of purchasing this device from Amazon. Those down I am going back to my LG V10. Good luck for those who choose this phone. It is an extreme nightmare. I will say this the battery life is excellent and the picture quality is also excellent. The use of is with all the apps is great until you run into that bug. Motorola should be ashamed of themselves for making such a device.,10.0,4

Seriously, no youtube... that's lame.Both of these con's are due to some internal setting. Apparently they can be solved when you root the system and update the firmware... but I just don't have time for that. I couldn't install Skype either. Another let-down.The good: Everything else. It is responsive, small and fast and I have my google calendar and email in sync. I only use it with WIFI. It seems that it can connect to AT&T using 2G. Not sure about 3G.To conclude: I am happy I bought this phone, but given a second chance, I would make sure it had the android market.",1.0,2

The phone can't compete with the top flagship phones today, but for its price, you can't really complain. Phone is nicely designed and it is almost as thin as a iphone 6+. Phone has a beautiful display and loud speakers that you can compete with the flagship phones today. That's where the difference ends. It has a slower snapdragon 615 cpu 2gigs of memory, no removable battery, nfc and wireless/quick charge. One design quirk that I don't like is the placement of the power and volume rocker. Most phones has power button to the right and volume rockers to the left, this is just the opposite. Not to mention that the power button is so high up in the phone. The phone looks nice but not very well protected so you should definitely get a case for it. Software is Lollipop 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1 that other flagship offers. Although I can't complain about the almost stock android experience which works fine for me. You definitely need a micro sd card if you want to put movies and mp3's as I only have 7 gigs free without having any media files stored internally. I hope that Alcatel can offer software updates like what the other flagship phones does.Should you get this phone, yes, but I would wait for Alcatel phone goes on sale as I brought mine for less than $200.Pro's- Has a beautiful 1080p display.- Very nice stereo speakers- FM tuner- Band 12 LTE for t-mobile phones- Nice, nice and thin design while maintaining a 2915 mah battery.Cons- Placement of power and volume rockers- Slower Snapdragon 615 cpu with 2 gigs of memory.- No NFC, wireless and quick charging- Android 5.0.2 rather than 5.1.1",1.0,4

It overheats so much that camera is not stable and will turn off after 1-2 mins of video recording, same for other serious products.

"Microsoft Lumia 650 (RM-1154) 16GB White, 5"", Dual Sim, Unlocked International Model, No Warranty",Nokia,127.95,3,"I used to love windows phones to death, had one for at least three years, but last year I decided to switch to an iphone 6. I didn't love the iphone os and it made me miss my windows os, yet I did adore the phone itself. However when it broke and had no warranty I decided to change it and buy again a windows phone. However, my return has not been great. Obviously this is a budget phone, but it does feel like a downgrade. I find that in the year I've been gone from the operating system there haven't been any improvement. There is still no Snapchat, google maps, and the app store feels worse than before. I also feel like the phone itself is slow some times and unresponsive. What I do love is the OS, despite the lack of apps I still adore the tile based UI that made me fall in love with it. Also, the xbox live integration actually makes me want to play games. It also feels and despite the price looks nifty. I am waiting for the surface phone to upgrade, but I do admit that if it doesn't have something mindblowing might have to return to iOS or Android .",2.0,3

The color or the case is very bright and may people have complimented the color of the phone. The camera is great, the photos come out very well. The phone is very fast with the quad-core processor and 1 GB of RAM. The screen is nice, altho not HD. You have to look really close to notice that the screen is not HD. Good call quality. The Speaker is very nice aswell. The earbuds that come with the phone are also very nice, plus the phone has a built in equalizer and 3D sound for headphones that works very well. The battery life is good as well being able to go for almost two whole days before needing to be charged, with moderate use. There are only two issues I have with the phone. One, the menu, home, and back buttons on the bottom do not stay lit up all the time when using the phone for power saving, i presume. This can be a bit of an issue when you are trying to use then and can not see them until after you have it one. The second issue it that there is only 4 GB of internal memory. For users that need to have a lot of apps this will present a problem. I have about 15 - 20 apps install on my phone, plus all of the things that come installed on the phone. This problem can be fixed with an micro SD card, which is very easy to install on the phone. The whole back part of the case comes off giving you easy access to the battery, two slots for sim cards and the slot for the micro SD card. Over all this phone is one of the best that I have had, while there are some minor issues they are not significant enough to deter me from buying this phone again.

I live in the United States so I had to buy another phone charger as the one that came with the phone does not fit in a US outlet. You can however, disconnect the plug and use it to charge on your computer. I went from a Galaxy S II to this and I have a Straight Talk Plan. I had to search on youtube how to get it set up through Straight Talk...apparently I had to turn the airplaine mode on and back off before I could use the internet?? Strange but it worked. Now that I have everything set up I love the phone!! Internet and videos are a lot faster and smoother with my new phone. I love it and would highly recommend it! Happy Customer :)",0.0,4

"BLU WIN HD LTE - 5.0"" Windows Smartphone -GSM Unlocked - White",BLU,109.99,4,"Great phone. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, let me also say that I am posting this review twice. Once under Blue and Yellow. I bought the Blue and returned it. I missed having a Yellow phone. A few of the pictures I am sharing between the two reviews.I bought this phone on 2/13/16 and as of this post, the phone has been selling since then for under $100. A great value.Under pros I would say the phones lite weight and comfortable design.Under things I would say are a little less the pro, but not a Con, would be the lack of feedback on the back, home and search buttons. All in all, not a big deal. I quickly got use to this. The camera is also adequate. It is not a Lumia Pureview camera, but then again the phone does not have a high end Lumia price.I only have one real Con for this phone: the volume of the ringer. It seems low, and I see another review commented on that also. I have mine turned all the way up to 10. On my Lumia 630, I had it at 5.The phone comes packaged with some EXTRA VALUE!!! The phone includes a screen protector and silicone case. Very nice.Lastly, this phone is Windows 10 Upgradable. The update was released on 3/17/16. The pictures of the Yellow phone home screen is Windows 10. The Blue Phone home screen is Windows 8.1 Sorry the pictures are not the best.",44.0,4

Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked GSM Smartphone - Mint (U.S. Warranty),,249.99,3,"A friend talked me into this phone. He bought it in the original Kickstarter campaign and had been reasonably happy with it after the initial bugs were fixed.What I like: fingerprint scanner works great and is super easy since I'm forced to have a lock on my phone for work. love stock Android, but still waiting on the nougat update. Not sure how long I'll have to wait for that. The size is nice but a bit on the small side as I went from a nexus 6 to this. Thin, flat, basic, nothing overly special or flashy which is just fine.The ""I can live with it"": The overall look is nice but the fit and finish could be better. There's an odd bulge on the back cover, almost as if they made it a millimeter to thin to fit the components properly. Where the top and bottom joins the body is a bit wonky too. It heats up real quick and easy. The screen is alright, decent looking, not magnificent.What I don't like: keep in mind I had a nexus 6, awesome phone, far superior to this one in every way. The auto dim feature on the screen is absolute crap. I had to shut it off because I was constantly being blinded. The screen brightness is either enough, or blinding.The speakers are ok at best. Turn it up too loud and you get distortion and clipping.The camera is also mediocre at best. The Nexus took amazing photos and video. This one always seems blurry, even when propping the phone on a surface. It doesn't seem to have any stabilization, not good in lower light, videos are unclear if there's a lot of movement, and sound quality is crap if what you're recording was too loud. I recorded a few songs at a Disturbed concert with the Nexus and they were clear, decent sound. The Robin all you hear is awful distorted noise. You can barely identify the song.Overall it is what it is, a cheap stock Android phone with no bells or whistles. YouTube Netflix and the like are decent, speakers are ok at a moderate volume.If you plan on using it for decent photos/video, but a Samsung or something else.",2.0,0

Beats the samsung galaxies, like the note 5.The camera is outstanding, except that it has no auto focus in video.It's fast and smooth.The operating system is modified android, but simple and similar to ios. Yoh can install any launcher from the google play store. I recommend the asus zenfone launcher. It has no adds.The speakers ars very loud.The sadvantages I see about it are the weight, the capacutative buttons are not lit, no auto focus in video and relatively it's heavy.This is a nice phone for the price.Compared to other phones:If you want the best phablet above 6 inch screen, get the Huawei P8 Max.If you want the best camera: LG V10.If you want a truly premium phone: Galaxy edge plus.If you want best budget phone: Zenfone laser 2, now it comes in 6 inch, and you can get it for $100 less from eBay.If you want to donate some money to support a rich company that does not need support and without any reason: IPhone 6S .Edit: 12/31:After using the phone for few days, I find that it's hard to see the capacitative buttons. They are not lit and even not marked. You can not see them except in bright light. The camera is useless except in good light. It has potential to be a great camera, but crippled with the bad software. Example: when you use flash, it choose high ISO , which makes the pictures washed out. If you choose pro mode, it becomes very slow. It has no auto focus.The launcher is a joke, and if you install third party launcher; you don't get the number notification; I mean for example if you have message or a missed call, you see the number of these on the messaging and phone icons. This becomes non functional with third party applications. Battery drains fast. So it worth 3 stars only, especially with the release of the ASUS ze601kl for a hundred dollar less.Edit: The more you use the phone, the more you find things you don't like:I get my pagers as messages, and if the message has a phone number to call, you have to make 5 press before you call. I mean five options!Will be returned.",6.0,4

Motorola Moto Q - Smartphone - CDMA2000 1X - bar - Windows Mobile - silver - Verizon,Motorola,18.5,2,"I've had a Smartphone for about two years, so I'm not one of those people who didn't like the ""Q"" because I expected PocketPC features on it. I switched from Cingular to Verizon for service reasons, and the Q seemed like the closest phone to the Audiovox SMT-5600 that I had and liked. It was definitely wider, but thinner, which seemed like a reasonable tradeoff.In my opinion, it turned out not to be. The phone was really too big to carry in a pocket easily. Once I decided that I needed to carry it on my belt, I decided to get the XV6700 instead. It's a lot thicker, but it has a slide-out keyboard with much bigger keys, plus a stylus/touchscreen and the PocketPC features. I'm very happy with that choice. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell that phone for Verizon (though they have the Sprint version).Other things I disliked about the Q:- The keys are impossibly small. I used a small blackberry for a long time and was fine with it, but some combination of the size and the feel of the keys made it very hard to use.- There are no dedicated keys for phone use. The whole point of a smartphone is to be a great phone first. Dialing a number on the Q is just plain hard to do. Finding the * and # keys is even harder! Finally, if you need to find any letter equivalents of the number keys, you're out of luck unless you've memorized them all.Good luck with whatever you purchase.",20.0,4

Samsung Galaxy J1 2016 J120M DUOS 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Android Smartphone - Black (International Version),Samsung,139.99,4,"I just received my Samsung SM-J120M/DS Galaxy J1 2016 Duos 4G LTE yesterday. If you want to know if this phone is compatible in a certain country check out frequencycheck on the web. Turns out this phone is compatible with 2G,3G,4G and 4GLTE in the US and many-many other countries while using 16 frequency bands. No CDMA bands on this phone though. Other more expensive phones like the Samsung G7 use 26 bands, but it also depends on the variant of that phone. i.e this is the Samsung Galaxy j1 2016 j120M/DS(North America version) there is also the J120FN, J120F/DS ,J120H/DS,and J120P variant. Each variant is made for a specific country or region. I dropped a star because it only has 8gigs of rom and 1 gig of ram. I would prefer at least 16 and 2, but that cost more. The phone seems to run just fine with 8 and 1 gig of ram though. Lollipop 5.1.1 runs at a quick pace the ability to multi task multiple apps . I read that Marshmallow can manage overhead memory better that Lollipop and has better power saving features, however I fear any possible marshmallow bugs and I'm quite satisfied with Lolli for the moment. I just let my phone perform updates today and it just modified lollipop it did not upgrade to marshmallow. I loaded temple run 2 and it takes a while to load, but runs smoothly. This phone came with about 3.6 gigs of free space out of 8 on the phone after the os, updates by user and factory installed apps. I did buy an external 32gb sd card as well. Apps will transfer to the sd card but only about 40% to 50%, this is a android issue, not the phone. The camera will id the sd card and use it for photos. Not too much bloat wear on this phone in my opinion. This phone is intended for North America, but after a five minute phone call(phone instructions) can be used internationally. I have not made that call yet. FYI beware of other vendors on Amazon selling the single sim version even though they advertise the duos version. A vendor told me that they had a mixed bag of single and double sim versions and would not be able to tell which type was shipped. The vendor Lifeline786 however did ship the correct dual sim to me. Good job Lifeline786! Be sure to contact the vendor prior to ordering.July 2016 Update: I traveled overseas(Indonesia) with this phone and used two different sim cards from two different companies. Both cards were able to give use 2g,3g, H+ and LTE in the overseas locations. However ATT tech support, here in the USA, was not able to affiliate the phones for LTE service. The tech said they didn't know why. We do get 2g,3g, H+ or 4G but no LTE with ATT. Also that five minute phone call needed to affiliate this phone in other countries is not really needed. We just worked with the sim card providers and they got our phone working. As far as using the phone, most apps work fine. Although memory management is required. Some apps take a lot of space. You only have about 4 gigs rom(plus sharing of space to the sd card) of space to use after the OS and factory software takes half of the 8gigs rom. Having only 1 gig of ram seems to be plenty I will often simply shut down apps running in the background and Lolipop OS 5.1.1 makes this easy.",22.0,4

Nokia C3 (C3-00) WHITE Unlocked Phone,Nokia,59.95,5,"Since I was due for an early upgrade on my plan, I checked around in the AT&T store for non-smartphone messaging-only options that did not require a data plan. Sadly, there were just a handful of options, half of which were unappealing flip style phones that I used over 10 years ago. AT&T store personnel stated that AT&T is intentionally driving existing customers to higher revenue smartphone and data plans and de-emphasizing messaging-only phones.*sigh*. Thanks for reducing customer options AT&T.So the search began to see what options existed in third party unlocked phones. The Nokia C3-00 caught my eye largely because it looked very much like my previous QWERTY bar phone, but it also had FM stereo and Wifi capability which had the potential to dramatically improve its day-to-day flexibility. In addition, user reviews across multiple internet review sites gave it overwhelmingly positive reviews.Before purchase I had some initial concerns about whether or not AT&T would identify the phone on their network as a smartphone since it uses the Symbian S40 operating system. AT&T said the phone's IMEI number is not among their list of smartphone IMEI's. I've gone through my first billing cycle and can confirm no forced smartphone data plan charges were assessed.As for the phone itself, day-to-day use has been great. Plugged my SIM card into it from the old phone (Pantech Link) and its worked beautifully right out of the box from day one. No problems at all.Battery life is typically 3-4 days between charges with moderate texting and several hours of daily FM stereo usage at work. Better than expected.Wifi works OK, not very speedy, but it does enable access to personal email and MSNBC/CNN at Starbucks. Just don't expect an iPhone-type browsing experience. It's basic but gets the job done. Better than expected. Note: If you DO opt for a data plan for this phone, bear in mind that it's an EDGE phone, not a 3G phone, so your data transfer speeds under a paid data plan will likely be a little underwhelming.FM stereo works super and is a nice inclusion on a phone at this price level. Earphone cord acts as the antenna and must be plugged in for reception. Sounds great, and again, better than expected.Keyboard is typical QWERTY layout. I found the tactile feedback quite pleasant and was easier to text on it than previous phone.Call quality is very good. No dropped calls. I can hear callers loud and clear and they can hear me the same.Nothing bothersome about the texting experience. It has a conversation mode similar to other phones and it works well. Only complaint is that individual texts within a conversation will only display the first two lines of the text. You have to drill into the text to see it fully. Not terribly annoying, but adds an extra step to the texting process. I suppose you have to accept some compromises when working with a 2.4 in display screen.Overall, I'd have have to say this has been a terrific phone choice for me. At $99, it's priced very well, offers expanded feature content and NO DATA PLAN requirement. It's a worthy option to similar carrier-provided messaging phones and a great value. Very happy camper.",17.0,4

It took forever to build the database of music, but after that, it was great.The charger problem is true. Some of my cables work, some don't.

I charged both phones and used one. Immediately the keyboard became Chinese language and also the phone went off and could open again. I decided not to risk my money I returned both of them immediately. Amazon should allowed not such fake phones in their market .This will have detrimental effect in their market and reputation. The good thing from Amazon is that they returned my money in 2-3 days. That perfect reputation with out question. I would advise other not take any phone like this which the package has been plastered.,0.0,0

"LG Optimus L9 P769, 4G (T-Mobile)",,57.98,5,"I have enjoyed the last few weeks with my LG Optimus 9 very much (once T-MO resolved issues on their side, but that's not the phone's fault). It seems very responsive, I have never noticed any lag at all. 4G speeds seem decent enough and it flies on wifi. The screen is a thing a beauty. Battery life is about a day which is what I expected from these types of smart phones.My wife got a Galaxy S4, and while I can tell it is faster and has more bells and whistles.... is it $500 better? NOPE.Some things I have noticed that do not detract from my experience, just things I wonder about...Once the phone turned itself off for no reason, and I had to remove and reseat the battery to get it to come back up. No idea why, had 50% or so of battery left. Strange.The touch screen doesn't like sweaty hands, I doubt this is a problem exclusive to the L9, just touchscreens in general. I was outside all day in the Texas summer heat the other day and someone called me.... I couldn't get it to register my finger swipe to answer the call, my finger was too sweaty. I had to find a dry spot on me to wipe it off (my sock was the only thing I was wearing that wasn't soaked to the bone) then call the person back. Maybe there is another way to answer a call I don't know about.The screen is really hard to see in direct sunlight, but then again so is my wife's GS4, our previous phones (optimus M and Galaxy S) and just about every cell phone I have owned in the last 10 years that uses an LCD screen. This is more of a gripe of LCD touchscreens in general, maybe someday they will come up with one you can see outside.The speakerphone at max volume sounds very echo-y if you are holding the phone. If you put it down on a flat surface it sounds better. Knocking down the volume a notch or 2 takes care of it.All in all I am very happy with it, and it was $500 cheaper than my wife's GS4.

Nokia Lumia 920 RM-821 32GB Black Windows 8 Smartphone 4G LTE (GSM Factory Unlocked),Nokia,79.95,1,"I've been a long-time Windows Phone user, and I absolutely love both, Nokia phones and the Windows Phone OS. I've used a Lumia 920 in the past, so I know it's a solid phone. So the 1 star rating is for the state the phone came in, and NOT for Lumia 920.Pros:- The phone is unlocked, as advertised.- There is no carrier branding on the phone chassis.Cons:- The phone came poorly packaged. It was in an opened box, and had clearly been used before.- When I turned the phone on, it did not take me through the Windows Phone ""out of box experience"", where I get to pick the language, settings, etc. Instead, I was taken directly to the start screen. For a phone that's being sold as new, this is NOT acceptable.- The device came from Mexico and has a Movistar carrier branding in the software - splash screen (which cannot be changed), ring tones, background, etc. The fact that I couldn't get rid of the original carrier branding in the software was a huge downer.- The phone is capped to 4G. I know that the Lumia 920 supports LTE, but when I went into the system settings, the ""Highest connection speed"" option only lists 2G, 3G, and 4G. So this must be a cap introduced by the original carrier. Either this must be clearly advertised on the product's page as a limitation, or it must support everything the Lumia 920 is designed to support. Again, unacceptable.- By default, the keyboard and language are set to Spanish, but these could be changed easily, so it wasn't a big concern to me.I bought this phone as a gift, but there were far too many reasons to return this phone, so that's exactly what I did. I'm hugely disappointed in Amazon for allowing such sellers to sell their products here.",4.0,0

"POSH MOBILE TITAN PRO HD ANDROID GSM UNLOCKED DUAL SIM 5.5"" HD SMARTPHONE EXTRA-large HD display, 13MP Camera and 8GB of Storage. 1 Year warranty. (Model#: E550 NAVY BLUE)",Posh Mobile,95.0,4,"I am a proud owner of the LG 320G phone since 2008ish. I like that it's not smart, lasts ages on a charge, and is very small. But everyone I know (all two or three of them) is like ""you need to respond to texts or else"", and on top of that it has started to malfunction.I caved recently and got this Posh Micro thing. I love it. It's even smaller, does everything a smartphone does, but is also too small for anyone to want to be glued to its screen. It's plasticky, but eh, it's also pretty inexpensive. Lasts longer than wife's iPhone on a charge, though not as long as my last phone.Kingroot worked no prob, though GravityBox took some trial and error, seems fine once I put it on the internal memory instead of SD card. The hardware seems sound. No interference in the audio jack. Fast enough.The Android install on it seems a little weird. It's the first I've used so I don't have anything to compare to, but a lot of things don't jive well with instructions on the internet. For example, the only way I can find to change the horrible default lock screen wallpaper (GravityBox doesn't work on this) is to press menu key on home screen and then desktop: not at all obvious. But the quirks are quickly learned, I guess.Edit: just want to report that I'm still very happy after a week. Sound quality is good, switching to small font was beneficial, and I got used to typing into the Google keyboard with my big hands. Battery lasts long if you don't play with it constantly, playing music doesn't affect batter much either. I realized it fits in that little mini pocket (for old fashioned watches) that jeans usually have within the normal right side pocket, nice! The hilariously small size of this thing seems more ideal the more I get used to it.I agree with the folks saying it's too bright; I used GravityBox to take minimum brightness down from default 20 to 4 (lower than 4 shuts of the screen), much more reasonable.Edit after a couple months: I'm sorry but as issues have turned up I'm singing a bit of a different tune, and lowering five stars to four. Like, don't love. I still have no interest in any other phone, but only because this is my only option in this size.One day the screen decided to have horizontal globs of dead pixels. Seems like a hardware problem as they're faintly visible with the screen off, however they change slightly every day, so I'm stumped.The vibration is damn near imperceptible through any clothing. Have this in your pocket for a while and you'll be more in touch with your otherwise ignorable spasms, because you'll be confusing them with the phone.USB connection is very flimsy at the phone side. It doesn't stay put, you have to really push and cram it in there till it starts charging, and then set it down carefully so that it stays connected.USB charger plug thingy emits a high pitched whine, just like most laptops of a decade ago. It's not severe, but enough that I keep it unplugged.OS issues: lots of small things. Can't change lock screen to anything beyond system defaults. Google keyboard reverts to Android keyboard on every boot, and sometimes on its own without boot. Sometimes when an app auto-updates, you get two icons for it, which show as the same in every other way, and uninstalling one uninstalls both.Like I said, I like it, but bummer about the problems. If this costed any more than fifty bucks these issues would earn it three stars.",17.0,0

I'm using it to make VoIP calls over Wi-Fi without a cell phone plan, using Google Talk and Google Voice (knitted together by the GrooVe IP app).Unlike others, however, my phone arrived with a non-standard Android 2.2 build. I suspect it was overstock from a carrier; but whatever the reason, the OS' build id was not listed by Google, and the phone was not receiving over-the-air updates from Google.Due to a Wi-Fi bug in Android 2.2 that caused the phone to lose Wi-Fi connectivity when the screen shuts off, I couldn't use the phone as I wanted until I got a software update -- so I had to go through the process of rooting it and installing an official 2.2.1 build myself, which is not for the faint of heart.The seller contacted me and explained that ""unlocked"" in this context means ONLY that the phone can be used with a SIM card on multiple GSM carriers. It does NOT mean that the phone's bootloader is unlocked. Unlocking the bootloader was necessary, on my unit, to install a standard Android build and receive over-the-air updates from Google. Unlocking the bootloader also voids the warranty (though this was not an issue for me, since the phone was out of warranty anyway).The phone now works perfectly and is receiving updates from Google.

BlackBerry Z30 Factory Unlocked Black - 16GB,BlackBerry,199.99,5,"Great phone. Got the STA100-2 version. Using it with Claro mobile provider in Costa Rica. Nice upgrade from Z10. Really fast. Non-replaceable battery but lasts much longer from that of the Z10 or any Iphone. Nice feel on my hand since it has rounded corner, unlike the Z10, always had to use both hands. Definitely would suggest to purchase this device. Using Snap you can download most Android apps. I have Instagram, Netflix, Vonage, IHeart Radio, Spotify, Amazon Music, Roku, Unblock US, Pandora and other Android apps running flawlessly on my device. Plus, there is nothing like Blackberry Hub.

"Samsung Galaxy S6 G920I Factory Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Platinum Gold",Samsung,319.99,1,"The Galaxy itself is an awesome looking phone with possibly the best display out currently. The colors are vibrant and the camera is excellent. The platinum gold is very unique and it seems to change colors depending on lighting - silver or gold. It's very slippery, but the dual glasses makes it feel premium. The performance is smooth as well. The phone itself is 5 stars. The one I received however is a 1 star due to the front glass panel being tilted. And yes, please read the critical reviews about the factory seals being broken or nonexistent. Mine came with no factory seal, just a one sided sticker that contained a barcode and place of origin. And please read their policies, because some of them are ridiculous. If you get this phone from the wrong seller, you will be screwed. I have a suspicion some sellers are actually selling refurbished (or phones that has been fixed) phones as brand new. All I can say from my experience, beware of WWD. Other than that, the phone is awesome, just be cautious.",15.0,4

Phone is really fast and I was able to buy brand new on sale for $186. For that price it beat all other phones for similar specs. Only thing I don't like about LG phones is that they really don't care about upgrading your firmware after they sell the phone, which is a shame because their phones are really capable of great things. For the same price this phone would be a much better choice than Motorola Moto G or even Blu Life Pure Mini (I own both).",1.0,4

So I was just looking for a cheap replacement until my contract is up and I can switch carriers. This phone does exactly what I want it to do and NOTHING more (no camera, no micro SD slot, nothing fancy). I don't have a data plan currently so I can't say anything about browsing the web. But this phone does have a very consistently strong signal and now I don't drop anymore phone calls. This phone is fairly easy to text with but, the buttons feel kind of cheap and there are a lot of sub menus ( and I do mean very many sub menus).

Motorola Moto G LTE- Factory Unlocked US Warranty (Black),,108.0,4,"When I first began shopping for a smartphone, the options were overwhelming. I wanted a smartphone that did what I needed it to do; but I also didn't want to pay the extravagant price of a flagship smartphone. While looking at what are commonly called "" budget smartphones"", one phone stood above all the others in this class --- the Moto G. I had high expectations for this phone, and it didn't disappoint.First of all, the good.1. The screen resolution is amazing. The Moto G's screen has 329 pixels per inch --- more than one and a half times the amount of pixels per inch for most budget smartphones. Viewing angles are also very good.2. The overall design of the phone is excellent. The Moto G feels sturdy in your hand, but it's far from heavy. I also enjoy the smaller screen size. I know this is very much a matter of personal preference, but for me the Moto G fits perfectly in my hand. Motorola hit a good balance between too big a screen and too small a screen.3. Ease of use. I have never owned an Android phone before, but the setup is very easy to learn. I have no trouble at all using the features on my phone.4. Price. The Moto G is approximately one third of the price for most smartphones. It's not quite as good as the more expensive smartphones, like the Galaxy S5; but not everyone can afford expensive phones. The Moto G provides the functionality of a smartphone at a reasonable price.5. Sound quality on the speakers is excellent.6. Performance on Android 4.4.4 is almost flawless. The Moto G has 1 GB of RAM, which I have found to be more than adequate.7. Overall value. You get a great smartphone at a great price!The not so good.1. Performance on Android 4.4.3. Until I upgraded to the next version of Android, I definitely noticed some hiccups in the performance. Once I upgraded to Android 4.4.4, performance issues were gone. Make sure you upgrade to the next version of Android or you might notice some performance issues.2. The camera. I knew I was only getting a 5mp camera, but to be perfectly honest it was worse than I expected. The camera is the reason why I could only give this phone a 4 star review.I am so happy I bought this phone. I believe my opinion of the Moto G can be summed up in one sentence: one of the best budget smartphones on the market today. You will not regret buying the Moto G.",3.0,4

Nokia Lumia 920 RM-821 32GB Black Windows 8 Smartphone 4G LTE (GSM Factory Unlocked),Nokia,79.95,5,"I love windows phones. I've had android and I couldn't wait until they started making windows again. I bought one with a lot of memory since the memory chips in the android phones do not work as advertised. This one has 32 gb and so far holds all the pictures, music, and audible books I want and I am no where near the memory limit.WHAT I DON""T LIKE:Mine came speaking French and did not have a qwerty keyboard. Fortunately, I knew enough French to fiddle with it, then gave up and let my 13 year old figure out how to turn it to English. Then I finally discovered that if you remove Chinese as the keyboard/language option, it goes back to qwerty keyboardIt has a good memory, but you can't add a sd or micro sd card to it.The maps I downloaded work 20% of the time, and never when I'm lost and need them, usually only on my street when I'm pretty sure I know how to get home.I have trouble downloading any pictures that are sent from android/Iphones. I usually text them and say - can't see it - it's annoying. Probably just a setting, but I've had it over a month and I still can't receive pics.I have yet to figure out how to get it to work on data v wifi. Better consult a 12 year old huh?WHAT I LIKE:The memory - it rocks!I have security cameras from blu iris that I monitor from my cell phone - this has enough memory to see my cameras when the Wi-Fi work.I love LOVE LOVE the way it interacts with Audible - I love listening to audio books and this app for windows on this phone works seamlessly so I can pop between stories with ease.I love that is ok with syncing my 5 or so email accounts for business work, kids, etc so that I can see all of them separated as they should be on my phone.I love windows.

"Huawei Mediapad X2 Tablet Phone (GEM-702L) 32GB Champagne Gold, Dual SIM, 7.0 inch, 3GB ROM - Unlocked International Model - No Warranty",Huawei,215.0,5,"I am UPDATING this review from 2-1/2 stars to 5..""Please read"".As I stated in my initial review (read below), this phone was SUUUPER SLOWW!!! Well im happy to say ""Not Anymore"", I figured out the problem! By a stroke of luck while me and my wife were tethering phones, I went into my settings under ""Wireless & Networks""...Then I clicked on ""More"" at the very bottom, then I went and clicked ""ON"" Mobile Networks, then scrolled down a bit and clicked on ""LTE CAT 6 CA"" and turned it ON... What happened next was magic!!! The phone asks to turn off, Click Yes/Agree, then phone asks you something along the line of...(Im paraphrasing here) states if your carrier does not carry/support LTE it may effect your phone service, ect. From here the phone will shut itself off and basically update the new LTE feature. From the second the restart ended, and the phone turned on, it was like ""light and day"" as far as speed! The speed at which I connect to websites, YouTube video's no longer load before they are done, and other sites with video ran smooth with no hiccup!!! I also figured something else out... If you go to ""Preferred Network Types"", the first option it shows is the one it needs to be on...4G/3G/2G (Gives you bubble to fill in, make sure ""THIS BUBBLE IS THE ONE AND ONLY YOU CHOOSE""!!! Looks like a mutiple choice bubble on School test. Just tap on it and exit!!! Also, NO NEED to look for firmware updates as other reviews have stated, the phone SHOULD Update itself, but if not, follow these steps... Go into Settings, go all the way down to where you see it says ""Updater"", this will be the 2nd from last button from the bottom. Click on ""Updater"", then click on ""Check For Updates""... The phone will automatically check for firmware updates for you!!! Also, my initial review was strictly about service, as far as your provider, as in T-Mobile or At&t. When it comes to being connected to Wifi, this phone is FAST!!! I do gotta say, this phone, by many in the industry labels it as a 3G phone, but it clearly shows 4G in the settings, which it has as it clearly has a LTE antenna, but it does not let you pick this option unless bundled with the 3G and 2G in the settings???? I dont get it!!! Anyway guys, hope this helped, it has been one he11 of a week with this phone until I figured all this out.BELOW MY INITIAL 1st Review....The phone itself is awesome, has the look, the feel, all the wonders of Android, ect, that every Samsung I ever owned has had. The issue is it's the SLOWEST phone I have had in prob 11 or so years! If you try to watch a video on any site other then YouTube, you better be prepared to set the phone down for awhile, and whn a video does start playing it only plays for a good 5-10sec and then the loading starts all over again! This is just unexceptable in this day and age, and even YouTube videos are a pain to get thru at times. I have yet to be able to watch a FULL Youtube video without the phone having to load itself half way through (say a 3-min video), unless it's a video with a still picture and just music, it handles tht task just fine, but an actual video with moving objects on screen, you better be prepared to watch tht spinny circle for awhile before reaching the end of it. Other reviews here also mentioned the issue with playing videos, so I know im not just an isolated case. This is a 3G phone, no 4G here folks! Huawei, just on this alone is a good 5 years behind other brands on the market. Also, this firmware update everyone talks about in their reviews is no where to be found in my world. I went on Huawei's website, NOTHING, the instructions don't give any info on where to download any update, and i have also searched the internet far and wide for a firmware update with nothing to be found. The girl who set my phone up at the T-Mobile store checked every detail for me in the phone and said it already has the latest firmware installed, and she knew her stuff! Now to give Huawei the benifit of the doubt, the phone being so slow could be due to my service provider (T-Mobile). I do know from a previous experience with T-Mobile in the area I am living (Racine Wisconsin) my wife was not getting the best of reception or internet at times, we had a hard time video chatting depending on where she was in the area. I will say tho, even in areas where I am getting a full 4 bars of 3G, I have the same problem with videos and loading issues aswel, even certain websites have a hard time loading, I have to reclick it 2-3 times for the phone to catch up. I do plan on switching over to At&t within the next 3 weeks just to be sure, but I am not too optimistic about this as no matter where I go the phone just has loading issues, IT's JUST SLOWWW!!! On the plus side, the 7-inch screen is simply beautiful, the battery last 4-EVER (good 2 days for me at times), and this phone is a head turner, lots of compliments to go around. I am coming off of a Samsung Galaxy Note Edge, which I payed almost $1000 for about a year an a half ago, but even at $350 for this phone, my wifes $60 LG Stylo is 5 times as fast at loading then this phone is. Once I switch over from T-Mobile to At&t I will give an update on the speed and loading issues, hopefully the phone will fix itself somehow. Or if I somehow magically come across an update that can fix these issues I will update this review aswel. In the mean-time im giving this phone 2 stars, I just cannot get over the speed issue. How this phone got such great ratings in beyond me! Maybe other reviewers have lower expectations due to their previous history with crappier phones??? IDK? But for me, and for the time being, this phone is a turtle trying to live in a world of rabbits.",2.0,0

Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 32GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty,Huawei,399.99,3,"After going through 3x LG G-series phones in as many years due to lousy build quality (bad touchscreen, screen detachment, bad motherboard/boot loop issues), I decided to abandon the brand. As a consumer, I prize build quality, durability, intuitive controls, and bang for your buck. To put things in perspective, my favorite all-time smartphone design is the Motorola Defy: it was built like a tank and worked underwater; it was rugged--you could drop it and it would barely scratch (no need for a phone case); had minimal bloat-wear; and served perfectly as an Every Day Carry (EDC) workhorse. Unfortunately, due to the current marketing strategy for cell phones, phones like the Defy are unicorns: the market currently is littered with disposable consumer goods built to be glass houses so manufacturers can increase profit. This led to a frustrating search high and low for a mid-tier phone that had good reviews with a decent camera; good build quality; impressive specs for the money; and a solid User Interface (UI) experience. That is, until I came across Huawei, and the Honor 8.Professional and amateur reviews I found were nearly universally positive, pointing to a beautiful body design; good customer support; good camera; good specs, and compatibility with T-Mobileâs 12 band (a lot of other Chinese-made, and international-version phones donât support 12 band). I started leaning towards purchasing an Honor 8 (U.S. Warranty), but the one thing that held me back were the divisive âlove it or leave itâ attitudes towards Huaweiâs EMUI. Then, I heard they would be replacing EMUI 4.1 in the near future, and Amazon featured a deep discount on Black Friday for the phone (selling it under $300), so I pulled the trigger and made the purchase. Iâm about 2 weeks into using this phone, and while I want to love my Honor 8 as much as I did my Defy, Huawei's EMUI 4.1 greatly reduces my enjoyment and experience. This is why I deducted two stars, as EMUI is non-intuitive, and can be extremely frustrating when you miss notifications because of EMUI settings. If and when Huawei updates EMUI away from 4.1, I will give an updated review.Pros:+The phone is relatively slim, and great for one-handed operation.+The phone is fast. The screen unlocks as soon as you touch the fingerprint sensor, and I havenât experienced lag on any apps.+Battery life is really good. I can go through my commute and work day without having to charge my phone.+The camera is decent quality (minor lag at times when itâs trying to focus), and has friendly controls. Iâve been spoiled by LGâs cameras, but I feel the Honor 8 performs well.+Beautiful external design, but slippery. Definitely get a case for this phone if you donât want it sliding around.+Vibrant display, and transition times between dark/brightly lit rooms is good.+The phone will turn on WiFi to connect to a known network when youâre in an area you frequent.Cons:-EMUI 4.1! EMUI 4.1!! EMUI 4.1!!!-Initial setup when switching from an old phone to the Honor 8 takes an extremely long time compared to stock Android. This is because EMUI has a bunch of settings you need to micromanage, ranging from app permissions, to notifications, to battery use. What I miss about LG is whenever I upgraded a phone, Iâd just connect the two phones via NFC and everything would sync up.-Settings continued: rather than having everything default to being enabled, you have to manually enable some settings. This means if youâre not careful, some of your social media apps and email apps might not be protected by the Battery Manager. This means they wonât run when your phone is off, and you wonât get notifications. This was extremely frustrating on multiple occasions, especially when people were trying to contact me on messenger apps.-No app drawer. It took me a while to figure out how to add an app icon.-Speaker is loud enough, but sound quality is poor and really tinny. This can make listening to some voices (especially high-pitched ones) really annoying. Good luck if you like listening to music, too.-No accessories besides a quick charger. It would be nice if the Honor 8 came with headphones, or an additional USB C-cable.-Other non-intuitive UI: When you slide down for Notifications, the Shortcuts (WiFi, Bluetooth, Flashlight, etc.) section needs to be clicked to access said menu. Itâd be better to just have both Notifications and shortcuts combined on the same screen, like with stock Android.-Iâm unaware of any profile options: for example, if I want to turn off vibrate and reduce my notification/media/call sounds in the office, I have to play with the volume buttons each time, instead of clicking on a Profiles shortcut to select Home/Work/Outdoors.-Volume and Power (restart/shut down) options can only be accessed with the physical buttons. It would help with UI if we can just slide down to the Notification/Shortcuts menu and be able to digitally manipulate the settings. This would also reduce wear and tear on the physical keys, and let users continue to use the phone if the physical keys break.**If the options Iâve mentioned above are available with EMUI, it just goes to show how unintuitive the UI is. Thereâs a lot to be desired in terms of intuitive controls, and I really hope Huawei will update EMUI as soon as possible.Final thoughts: The Honor 8 is a great phone that suffers from bad UI design. If EMUI were designed as beautifully as the Honor 8 phone itself, or were replaced with stock Android, I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to friends and family. As it stands, however, I can only recommend this phone for people who are intermediate to advance users, who either enjoy micromanaging their settings, or are comfortable with doing so. Given the Honor 8âs current EMUI, I would not recommend this phone as a gift for someone new to smartphones (parents, grandparents, etc.). I'm not happy to give such an average review, because the Honor 8 has great specs, price, and looks. It's just the UI that suffers.

HTC Vivid X710a 16GB Unlocked GSM Android Dual-Core Smartphone - White (No Warranty),HTC,97.99,4,"It's a good enough phone, but for me the battery life was very disappointing. Let me start by explaining that this is my first smartphone and I got it mostly for the screen size and camera; the FM radio is also a nice feature, as I always like this in my phones but didn't think smartphones even bothered adding this. Anyway, in contrast to most smartphone users, I'm not one to use a lot of downloaded apps and have no need to be constantly updated or connected online; I text some, talk a little (I'm not a chatterbox) and listen to music once in a while and that's about it. The first few days I hardly used it at all, and yet the battery would drain pretty fast. Soon enough I learned to turn off Wi-Fi, unnecessary apps (background data), turned off synch on email, etc. but the battery was still going fast, and so was my data allowance (have very little data on my prepaid plan, since I never used much on my previous device, a ""dumb"" phone). Uneasy about the battery life and unwilling to upgrade to a plan with more data, I finally decided to just turn off its internet connection in the settings; I only turn it on to send or receive pic messages (which isn't often) or to do a web search (even less often). Doing this has finally extended my battery to about 3 days and data is no longer being devoured. I get that doing this basically defeats the purpose of having a smartphone in the first place, but like I said, I got it mostly for the screen size and camera; if there'd been an all-touchscreen dumb phone with the aforementioned features, I would've bought that instead.Something currently bothering me is the notifications for texts and missed calls. It only sounds once and that's it, so as a result, sometimes I don't become aware of missed texts or calls until much later. I've tried searching in settings for a way to change this, but can't seem to find the option (my phone is not rooted). With all of my previous phones I was able to choose how often to be notified (every minute, every 5 minutes, etc.) so I'm surprised that this phone doesn't seem to have that. It does have a tiny blinking green light as an alert of something missed, but it's barely visible and it's on for only a few minutes.",6.0,0

Motorola Moto G LTE- Factory Unlocked US Warranty (Black),,108.0,5,"This is a review for the unlocked Moto G 4G LTE model which I am using on Metro PCS in San Francisco. I've had the phone about a month and use if for a variety of things daily. I""m pleased by its size, the clarity of the screen, good call quality and good battery life. When I first activated the phone, Metro could not get the 4g LTE to work consistently. I did a little research and found that one needs to put in a different Access Point Name on this phone, at least here in SF. The key APN settings are as follows: APN: fast.metropcs.com MMSC: http://metropcs.mmsmvno.com/wapenc. If you're having trouble, take your phone to a Metro PCS store and ask them to enter that APN. Or, you can also do a little online research and you'll find the complete settings. Since putting in the correct APN, its been perfect, good LTE signal just about everywhere I've been and quick pickup of H+ or H when I go out of LTE range. The only issue I really have isn't with the phone but with Android 4.4.4. Some readers will know that in this version Android has significantly limited the apps you can put on your SD card. Not surprisingly, this means that its easy for the phone storage and memory to get too crowded too fast. Having said that, if you are looking for a good performing, reasonably priced phone and are willing to use your apps strategically, for example, skip the huge FB app and just access FB via the browser, this phone is great!",3.0,4
Nokia Lumia 900 AT&T GSM Unlocked 4G LTE Windows 7.5 Smartphone - Cyan Blue,Nokia,129.95,4,"This is my first windows phone and so far, I am enjoying it. The price point here is better than if I had bought it in the store I checked (you know, that US carrier that advertises it does not ""lock you into contracts""). The phone does everything I need it to do and the features are exactly as advertised. No unpleasant surprises. My only disappointment is that this particular phone is not ""factory"" unlocked (and the sellers do not claim it is). So ATT branding is on the phone and on some of the apps. Since I use this phone overseas and am not an ATT customer, I would prefer not to have these ATT demarcations on my phone. In the past, I have been more careful to select a factory unlocked phone but overlooked that detail this time.

(1 Year Warranty) (International and Domestic use)",Posh Mobile,129.88,4,"I ordered this phone the 3rd and arrived on August 6 just right on time. I would gave five star, but I'm still watching the battery performance and it is not good, but again it is too early to tell reason why is draining so fast, anyway I am working on it and would let you know by the end of the month what is going on with the battery. Another reason for 3 star is the ""idle time"" This phone/Phablet doesn't come with in-built ""Never"" or anything to control and keep the phone awake when I need to do something for a long period of time or when I'm watching a movie which is very annoy. In overall the phone is not bad or worst than any other low badge phone, but it could be a much better Phablet, if they can fix the idle time issue. Anyway such a small detail, but so important that it just doesn't make any sense to me. Of course, Google play has a bunch of Apps acclaiming to keep you phone awake, but it is not truth. I tried five different Apps to control the ""idle time"" and none of them worked out. finally, is it a good phone for the price. This is a updated, anyway the phone is working fine, it froze once while I was downloading a few apps, but a soft reboot fixed the problem. I want to let you know the battery is not too good, but it is not the worst, anyway it is good phone for a gift so I gave it to my cousin and he like it.",0.0,2

BLU Life XL - LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 8GB +1GB RAM - Dark Blue,BLU,129.99,5,"BLU Life XL - LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 16GB +2GB RAM - Dark BlueI purchased this phone to replace a worn out Samsung Galaxy S2 that I dropped, causing EOL (End of Life) of that hand set. I had to call upon my old HTC LEO that had been NAND Flashed with ICS 4.4.2. My wife calls it my Franken-phone. I was certian I had become a ""Samsung"" guy, having never been short-changed by a Samsung device of any type. Seriously, how many can say they were still using a S2 until last month. However, it pains me to even think about spending $500+ on a new phone. Therefore, I set out on my quest to find a good as new S5, or something reasonable. I stumbled across this handset while searching for my 'new' handset. After reading the glowing review by Armin Tamzarian (http://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A2XCCN239AR1XK/ref=cm_cr_dp_pdp) on BLU Phones, my mission inadvertantly became a quest to see which BLU handset would please me. I don't get sidetracked, really I don't. I am a buyer, not a shopper. In about 5 minutes I had selected the BLU Life XL- LTE as it had everything important to me. A good processor, lots of RAM, ample storage, high power camera, LTE, great price... oh yeah, and it would work... I figured at that price I could give it to my grandkids to play with if I didn't like it. For that price, I could by 3 or 4 or so before I reach a new top of the line handset. When it arrived it was packaged nicely. I took the phone out of its box and checked it over. It was very slim and every part fit well. I'm not sure about the owners manual, it was kinda sketchy, but who really needs one these days. Our society has made leaps and bounds from the flashing VCR light of the 80's. Pretty much any 3 yr old can work a new phone, no matter how complicated it is. If you need help, I might be able to have my grandson walk you through. He was on Youtube in a matter of seconds when he had his go at it, watching Steven Segal movie clips. I removed the back. It was much easier than a Samsung has ever been, but not so easy as to come off all the time. I plugged my Micro SIM and my 32 gig SD card in, put the battery in and powered it on. The battery had an 80% charge and took me through a few start up screens. It asked me which backup I wanted to restore from, the S2 or the HTC NEXUS (my Franken-phone). I chose the S2, it took off. I logged into my GMAIL account and almost everything was restored from the S2 into this new, sleeker, unheard of device. Being the skeptic, I have to say I was impressed at the ease of the setup. However, I was not going to be that easy to sway over to the BLU, but it had already intrigued me thus far. I noticed that the Live ""Black Hole"" back ground was the same one I had on the HTC and think is just awesome. My Carrier had originally offered the Live backgrounds on the Samsung devices, but took them away because they ate battery life and caused numerous complaints on the subject. SO, I wanted to see how this one fared running it 24 x 7. I charged up the battery to 100% before I started any real testing. So far, BLU has won me over. I have measured it against a Note 3, an S3, Galaxy 10 tablet on WIFI, an iPHONE 5, and my old standby the rooted HTC LEO. It is faster than them all, and has not locked up one single time. The radio in it is very strong and even out does the HTC LEO on reception (in the past the HTC LEO had always surpassed many handsets in reception with the OEM Windows CE, or in rooted Android. It has been touted as the phone that won't die). All my calls have been crystal clear, even in areas I had had trouble with in the past. I continued my testing. I tried to cause problems by leaving Chrome, Opera, Gas Buddy, Yahoo email, Gmail, IMDB, YouTube, Messaging, Google Maps, and Navigation apps up and running and felt no adverse effects. I let it run 20 hrs, all the time i made a few calls, surfed the web, took some pictueres, set it up as a WIFI hub, did a few searches with my laptop, and it still had 20% battery life. We took a trip last weekend to see one of our Daughters and her family. on the way I handed it over to my wife to check out. I now get the ""honey, let me see your phone"" quite often since. She thoroughly tested the camera, facebook app, and internet on the road reading an eBook. No complaints. The camera passed with flying colors. I guess I know what to get her for her upcoming birthday. It always seems that the 'name brand' handsets slow down at 6 months or so. You know, when the new handset offerings hit the market. I will update this posting around that time if it slows. If not, then you will know I am still happy... At this point, the BLU Life XL has become my favorite phone of all time. I have retired my rooted HTC Leo back to its rightful position in my drawer. Lets pause for Stay tuned to see if it needs to be called upon again...",21.0,4

The battery charger is great quality too, and is the preferd one for everybody in the house because is is firm and you are sure it is charging your phone every time you plug it in. I use it in Argentina and it runs perfectly with my local carrier.It also inclueded gorilla glass, extra protection shell (golden, I love it too) and it fell to ground many times already (mother of three spirited boys will understand why) and it doesn't even have a scratch!Camera quality is good enough and frontal camera is a good extra option for online chats, it includes many editing and selfie options which I don't use but you may like them too.Cons: the memory runs out quite quickly, but I added an external sim card and that problem was gone.I really think this is an amazing phone for the price.

I think the battery may need replacing in the near future.I bought a backup battery you plug in..so I am all right, most of e time.You can still get a lot of apps, just not most new ones, as it use iOS 6.?I use the Phone with a provider that is only $15 a month including 400mb of data.Overall I am happy..to have a iPhone.

Posh Mobile Micro X S240 GSM Unlocked Smartphone - Pink with SanDisk Ultra 32GB microSDHC UHS-I Card with Adapter,,97.59,4,"This isn't a substitute for a ""real"" smartphone, but if you can find it at a good price ($30-40) this is a great portable secondary phone. It's the smallest and most portable smartphone I've ever seen, and would be best used by swapping in your SIM specifically when you need a smaller-than-normal phone for one reason or other, perhaps because you don't want something to happen to your regular, more expensive phone. That's realistically the only scenario you should expect to use this phone in, because it has a lot of compromises to get at this size and price point. It's slow, runs an outdated version of the OS, has limited internal storage, and has a small battery. Worst of all, the display is so tiny that not only is it difficult to see, the interface elements can't all fit and they overlap (and forget about trying to type and simultaneously see what you're typing!) That being said, it otherwise works as you'd expect any other Android device to. As long as you don't try to install a ton of apps, the limited storage is manageable. Pretty much everything I have installed works; it does fine with streaming audio and video, including playing media from my Plex server! The battery is small, but is also sufficient: in standby mode it only uses a percentage point or so every few hours, and only when you try to continuously use the phone does it drain noticeably. The standby time is probably measurable in days, whereas continuous use might last you a few hours. That leads to my use case: I've decided that since I have multiple devices anyway, and have a habit of not taking along my phablet when I don't think I'll need it just because it's larger than practical, I'll just leave my SIM in the Posh and toss it in my pocket. I really don't notice it's in there, and I can carry it around all day just in case; I still have my phablet, Nexus 7, Pixel C, etc. when I want to actually use a practical Android device. So to summarize, the Posh S240 isn't a very practical device, but it's a surprisingly usable phone that won't let you down.",2.0,4

Samsung Galaxy S3 SGH-i747 4G LTE GSM Unlocked 16GB No Warranty (White),Samsung,88.0,1,"I purchased this item through Amazon Prime from a company called ""Breed"" and it is not authentic. The sticker on the inside of the phone is something printed on a home printer (with poor print quality).I called Samsung customer service and the IMEI number was a legitimate one (the phone was made 11 months ago) but it was mysteriously out of warranty already. Next, I called AT&T and told them I had bought this new phone and would they be able to accept it. They looked up the IMEI number and it turns out that the phone had been through their liquidation department. The rep explained that this meant that the phone had been returned and it was considered defective. This explains why the phone no longer carries the 1-year warranty.I called Amazon customer support and they will give me a refund but they seemed very relaxed about the whole thing. They will not report this back to ""Breed"". I am outraged! I paid almost four hundred dollars and got a knock off or, at best, a refurb. I had stayed away from e-Bay because I did not want to get a phone that was not authentic. I put my trust in the Amazon Prime program.

Got it for $300 though it still feels a bit too much for this..It's alright overall but there are things that i really didn't like about the device:- battery drains too quickly- fingerprint sensor on the back is far less convenient than on the front like iPhone- on-screen buttons eat space, i'd prefer physical/sensor- the dynamic sounds like total crap- camera has 0 stabilization so it's hard to get a steady shot especially on video- 16gb is effectively only 10gb which is just not enough for normal use- the size is too big for onehanded use - very inconvenient- call sound quality seems a bit poor..Gonna keep it for a while probably, but as soon as iPhone 7 comes out gonna switch definitely.",3.0,4

About three weeks later my Mom wanted to finally get a smartphone so I figured I would give her this one.Thats when I noticed it would only turn on for about 15 minutes then turn off. So I out another battery in the phone being that I had an old 822 that my wife had busted the screen digitizer. It works for about one day but would not charge. So I bought her a wireless charging plate. Still would not charge. After two days on the plate it powered on after trying both batteries. Now the touch screen would not work. Finally put the screen and digitizer on my wife's old 822 and threw away this phone. Very disappointed in this product they pretty much sold me a new screen on a faulty broken phone.",0.0,0

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Silver,BLU,139.0,5,"I can't possibly say enough good things about this phone. It's inexpensive, runs great, is absolutely beautiful, and has a front facing flash. Yes, a front facing flash! The HD screen is great for watching videos on and is very responsive. The phone doesn't have an app drawer, and the apps are all laid out on the screen, pretty much like an iPhone only you can add widgets and stuff. This is a drawback for some people, but it's one of my favorite things about this phone. The sound is very loud, which is great when I lay on my good ear (I'm half deaf in my left ear) in bed and want to watch YouTube videos. Works in perfect harmony with my LG G Watch, and the special little notifications menu thing has all sorts of convenient things that you can do, like turn the wifi or bluetooth on and off, audio profiles, airplane mode, FLASHLIGHT. Most phones you'd buy for this price come with an outdated version of android, but with this phone here oh no, you get Lollipop (At the time I'm writing this, it's the latest version of Android). If you don't want to use it as a phone, and you just want to play music and stuff on it and check your facebook, that's cool too! I've had phones that gave me a no service message when it didn't have any service (Ohhhh gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood), but all this does is have a little notification icon on the notification bar of a sim card. No annoying reminders every 10 seconds. Best phone ever.Also a note on the shipping.

"Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",Nokia,193.5,2,"I am so disappointed this phone did not work out. I was highly impressed with the Nokia E71, except for one essential. Due to a hearing problem, I keep my cell phone on vibrate 100% of the time. I tried this one in my pocket, and in a good quality waist/belt case, and could never feel it even though I'd just called it myself from our land line, and knew full well that it was ringing. Only when I held the phone in my hand directly could I feel it - vibration was exceptionally weak.Why so harsh if the rest of the phone is so good? Because I can't conceive of a cell phone without a usable vibrate option. Even if I had good hearing in both ears, there are times when only the vibrate option is appropriate (school, church, work meetings, etc.). Without it, I consider there to be no reason to own it. No vibrate option makes for a no-go for me.I ended up getting a Blackberry Curve, and really like it, but I'd still rather have the Nokia E71 after only a couple of days using it - just as long as it had a decent vibrator.There is one ""be aware"" item with this phone - apparently NONE of the major US carriers offers this phone as an option. I don't know why, since T-Mobile does offer it in Europe. But I was not deterred by that, and found out that at least T-Mobile tech suppport can still be quite useful even with this phone (I had a data-transfer issue right after I got it, and T-Mobile was able to get me through the issue quite satisfactorily.Bottom Line: except for the vibrator being very weak, this would otherwise have ended up with at least a 4-star rating, and very likely 5 stars.",1.0,0
"Apple iPhone 6 128GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone, Silver (Certified Refurbished)",,417.35,2,"Represented as certified refurbished. The cable(slightly shorter) and charger are not original.Most importantly, the charger has no test lab approval markings. Various companies conduct tests for quality and safety. Although test lab approval may not be required by law, many local agencies frown on non approved products and may prohibit their use especially in schools and hospitals. Better manufacturers submit their products for testing and evaluation approvals which can be lengthy and very expensive.I suppose if I asked the manufacturer for support regarding charging issues, their first question would likely be, ""Are you using an original charger?""If I were the manufacturer of the phone, I would be very concerned about the substituting of the original charger with charger not bearing an approval from one of the test labs.",24.0,0

"Apple iPhone 6 Plus, Gold, 64 GB (Sprint)",,107.98,5,Love it! Previously had an iPhone 5S with 64 gigs and was battling running out of space. I'm loving that now 128 gigs can hold what I'm throwing at it.This phone is significantly faster than the 5S particularly when navigating between apps and loading things.The big screen is terrific! Typing is so much more accurate because with a larger screen each of the letters are bigger. I have big hands so this has dramatically cut down on typos.The 5S struggled to stream to Apple TV and drop connection. The 6 Plus hasn't had a hiccup in the least so far with Apple TV.I really like the fingerprint ID to unlock the screen! Most people only do it once and that is why it doesn't recognize perfectly. You can scan up to 5 fingers. I ran it on my right thumb three times from every angle possible. Then once on left thumb and once on right index finger. It is rare that I ever need to try a fingerprint to unlock more than once. I also setup a passcode that is over 40 characters so I have never felt like a phone was so secure.This pup was expensive but I don't regret the purchase in the slightest. Well done Apple!,1.0,4

Considering you won't probably buy the 16 GB version and that the difference between the 32 GB version and the Nexus 6P is 80 USD I think is worth spending a little extra on the 6P.The only exceptional thing about the phone is the camera, finally a good camera in a Nexus, even without IOS.********************UPDATE***********************DO NOT buy this phone, when updated to Android Nougat the phone enters in a boot loop everytime your try to turn it on, this is due to a hardware malfunction according to Google.

This phone heats UP big time! Especially after using for couple of minutes (just browsing and some Apping)!!! If you run Antutu, man, you probably can fry an egg on the nice etched back glass.However, you can't really blame on Sony, it's Qualcomm SD810's fault. But again, why do you want to use SD 810, Sony??? Just use the SD808! For God's sake, use SD801, who cares about 32 or 64-bit. So, it's kind of Sony's fault.Minus b**ching about SD810, the phone itself is great!Pros:- Great screen, beautiful color, and VERY bright.- Simple and nice UX- Camera focusing is fast, but images can be noisy indoor/low light- Very premium feel, wonderful design. Thumbs up for the back etched glass... No more fingerprints all over the phone!Cons:- Heat problem. Although Sony probably set a higher temperature threshold for apps to shut down by SW, you can still feel it.- Battery life isn't that great. I have a z3, and it seems to last longer and COOLER.- Volume bottom's location is a bit awkward.- Sony, can you just hire some image processing engineers from Apple? You have great image sensors.

Will try to resell the covers. We bought two phones for our vacation and one quit working all together before even reached our destination. The other worked, but only minimal and was constantly overheating. It would not keep a charge for more than an hour so it had to be plugged in constantly. This was a huge disappointment. I had hoped to keep these for future vacation, so now I will need to purchase new ones again. I sure hope to find good ones this time.",0.0,4

I shut off my iphone and went to this phone only because I did not use the data plan much and did not want to pay for data any more that I was not using. To my surprise Verizon Wireless charges data to use this phone and tells me that this phone uses data to operate. Man did I hit the roof on that when I found out. What's the point of having this phone if I have to pay for Data. I might as well turn my iphone back on. The charge they charged me was less than my iphone but the point is I still have to pay for it to operate it. I am going to turn my service off and go without a phone I'm just sick and tired of being screwed by Verizon and paying for something I DO NOT WANT!!! Great phone other wise.,,0

So, I researched all over amazon's choices. This watch seemed to be excellent. It came in, I didn't even open it, just gave it to my son, excited. He's 14 and a tech junkie. He took one look at it and tossed it aside. He's about 6 feet tall and a big guy. So, it shocked me to hear him say that the watch was not for him. He said the watch face, itself, is much too huge, too thick, too big for him to wear. He didn't like it so much that he disregarded any tech capabilities on it, altogether and wasn't interested in it any further. He left on the table beside him and didn't give it a second look even though I advised him all it could do. Nope, not even remotely interested because it was too big. I tried to attach a photo to show you why the thickness is an issue with him. I've still not used the item and the purchase was a long time ago. I'm keeping it though, hoping that one day, it will be useful to me. I'm thinking it may be useful for jogging purposes. But, I, really, can't speak up on it. I haven't used it. No one wants to wear such a thick faced watch. So, the technical features have not, yet, been experienced. So, if, I do take the time to find someone to use it, I will be sure to update you on that. The three stars is only that no one wants to wear it.",9.0,0

Verizon LG enV2 VX9100 No Contract 3G Camera QWERTY MP3 Cell Phone Maroon,LG,80.0,1,"My experience with this purchase was a complete disaster. First, the Seller advertised it as a new phone. But when I received it, it already contained contacts, text messages and pictures. I contacted the Seller & he refunded part of my money since it was a USED phone. Then, when I took it to Verizon to activate it, the guy put me in a TWO-YEAR contract even though it was a NO CONTRACT phone. Next, I wanted to activate the EZ Navigator app while I was on an out-of-state trip. I was told I needed a software update which I could get at any Verizon Wireless store. I went to one store in Arizona and one store in Oklahoma, both of which told me they didn't do software updates on that phone anymore. Then, we discussed the possibility of upgrading to a new phone. That was when I found out the guy who activated the phone put me in a two-year contract with a no-contract phone. Then, I had to call Verizon and speak to various supervisors several times to convince them I wasn't even supposed to be in a contract so there shouldn't be an upgrade fee. Finally, one person realized that I really was NOT supposed to be in a two-year contract so she changed the records. In spite of that, Verizon still wanted to charge me an upgrade fee.

"Samsung Galaxy S7 Unlocked PhoneDual Sim Factory 32 GB Internationally Sourced (Middle East/Afican/Asia) Version G930FD,(Titanium Silver)",Samsung,679.99,5,"Should I buy the Samsung Galaxy S7?I am speaking of the Asian version with duo slots not the north American version.I had an iphone 6s , went overseas to work for a few months I was using the iPhone 6s it worked fine , except for a 4G connection and lte use overseas , I called apple ask them what type of bug they put in their phone for limiting service providers on the speed of the Internet, they did not fix an issue which I am not going to details about an apple freak would know the problem my of the public is not aware about . Any way I did a lot of reading and research on the better phone . I came across the Samsung s7 specifically the Asian version . At first I was very hesitant about getting it , I was not convinced till I tested the phone now I am convinced it is the world's most fastest phone to surf the net .I have put up a screen shot of the proforma center and no restrictions like Apple on network speed . Now I have placed my iPhone 6s as a paper weight . There goes apple support. The fix is the Samsung s7 . Yes it works well in Africa , Asia, Europe in any network without a certifications need without carrier is not certified issue unlike like Apple.There isnât a better Android phone out there right now. The Nexus 6P comes close, but itâs much larger, and the Galaxy S7 Edge is a lot more expensive. For the majority of people, Iâd say the Galaxy S7 is the phone to pick.It looks great, feels a lot better than the Galaxy S6 due to the curved back, and it performs like a champ.It also has the best all-round camera on any phone, thanks to crisp images and a fuss-free app thatâs fast to open, focus and shoot.Samsung has taken the Galaxy S6, an already excellent phone, and fixed just about everything wrong with it. UPDATE .. dated 28-7-2016 , if you buy this phone get a cover and a screen protector , I accidentally dropped the phone from a 2 meter escalator facing the screen head on the phone survived the fall with a single shatter on the screen , still working but the shatter is visible from an angle, I purchased a screen seal so the shatter won't spread all over , I did a search on replacing the screen , no one is willing to replace the screen due to some type of a glue on the system Board, I have to wait until a phone technicians know to prefect a replacement screen on the s7 and 7edge. I would not take the star due to my fault . Be careful not to drop the phone on a hard surface , prone to shatter if not protected !! Like any other smart phones . I did get the cracked Glass on the front replaced with no hassle . The waiting was about 3 hours at the Samsung center in bejing , it can out like new , no cracks that bothered me for a while , I had to pay for the service of replacement on the front Glass, now learned , I did get a screen protector and a solid cover . If you buy a glass shatter phone it is a must to buy the cover and glass shield.. love the phone as far as proformance and speed ..Here we go apple .. watch out ..",12.0,4

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 16GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,449.0,2,"Disclaimer: this review is mostly about the widespread bootloop issue, and some comments about the quality of the phone in general.I - Marshmallow had performance issues. Nougat made it great.I bought this phone in December 2015. On the first weeks, this phone was plagued by weird performance issues: slowdowns, quick freezes and just mediocre performance that constantly required rebooting in order to regain the smoothness it should have: being a Nexus 5 (not 5X) owner myself, I knew this one couldn't possibly be so inferior to its predecessor. Recently, the Nougat update finally turned it into the perfect phone for me, and so I was satisfied.II - Soon after, LG Bootloops appeared, rendering phone unusable.This week, I was yet another person hit by the infamous LG bootloop defect. If you don't know already, I sincerely recommend you inform yourself about it before buying this phone. Many LG modelsâand most of the expensive ones, 5X, G3, G4 etc. includedâare plagued by some sort of these defects.As far as I know (I'm not into the technical details), there is a hardware defect on this model regarding the flash memory chip, a problem at the project level. For what I've heard, LG is issuing full refunds for those who are eligible for warranty in US. For those outside United States, or that bought the phone while in US, you are probably better giving it to a recycling center or selling it for parts, I'd guess.III - What to do?Nothing. In my particular case, and many other for what I've seen on XDA and other sites, there is no way to recover as this appears to be due to low quality of the hardware. Even trying to flash images through specialized software (with TOT images) is not possible, as the firmware download software on the phone will freeze, just like the regular boot system.IV - Alternatives and comments about other aspects of the phone.Still, that loses your time, gives you a headache and a surprise you didn't prepare yourself for, forces you to buy a new phone (if you live outside US, like I do, sorry), perhaps a larger 6P or a very expensive Pixel.Shame, because besides being a Nexus and having plenty of potential, it also has a wonderful camera that can truly take excellent pictures, especially if you know what you're doing. I'm including some samples on this review, just remember that this is a small sample that does not make justice to the full, pixel by pixel originals. Panoramas and photo spheres also come much better than the ones in my old Nexus 5 ever did. Other than that, I don't need to tell you because if you're looking for a Nexus 5X you already know what to expect and you made your homework by now.That said, this the summary of my review:- Running Marshmallow: 3 or 4 stars out of five, because of sudden performance issues.- Running Nougat: 5 stars. No complains.- Widespread bootloops and possible project defect less than a year after *release*: 2 stars because it was very good with Nougat.V - Avoiding LG phones.On a sidenote, my Nexus 5 also failed due to a hardware defect: the power button issue, which also gives you bootloops, rendering your phone unusable after quite a few months depending on the usage profile. Because of that, 2 disappointments out of 2, and considering the widespread issues with other LG models, I'm quite sure it will be a long, long time before I buy any LG phone ever again. I have many old phones (an old GNex running Marshmallow, to name oneâ¦) that I use for testing and I don't remember suffering from things like this in any of them.",0.0,4

"ZTE Z431 Unlocked GSM Phone with 2.4"" Display, 2MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, GPS, SNS Integration, Muisic Player and microSD Slot - Black",ZTE,21.8,4,"I purchased this phone for several reasons and it has proven to be a great purchase. First, I needed a new MP3 player that was rechargeable, played for at least 12 hours per charge and would handle free library Overdrive books. My small clip-on Sansa disk players were great while they lasted, but completely unreliable. After the 6th $40 player quit after only a couple of weeks I gave up on them. I also needed a prepaid phone that would allow me to text with ease, but discovered that a prepaid plan for a smart phone was always at least $10/mo more, even if I never used data. I have a tablet and don't need an expensive smart phone too. With the unlocked Z431, for $30 I was getting a good MP3 player, a phone that made texting easy and only had one item to carry with me instead of two. In addition, this phone has bluetooth so I was able to ditch the earbuds with cords that kept getting in the way. I can use the phone for talking and playing books for several days without having to charge it (never done that with a smartphone). The phone was AT&T unlocked so I could get a free Sim from PureTalk USA which has a unique plan allowing me to pay as little as $10/month for minutes or automatically adds blocks of time if I need more, with extra minutes rolling over. I use anywhere from 200 to 800 minutes a month so this flexibility means I don't run out, and don't pay for minutes I never use as I did on a previous StraightTalk plan. The phone/media player is not perfect (hence 4 stars}. I wish it played wma as well as mp3 format books, but since most are available in both formats can live with that. A 5-star phone would also have a sleep timer and flashlight.Adding books was a definite learning process so I am including the steps to doing that here.1) You must purchase and insert a memory card.2.) Download the software and Overdrive books to your computer using your library site.3.) Connect the phone to your computer via USB and wait for Windows to load drivers4) Go to Computer to find the player symbol under Players with Removable Storage and double click5) A window with ""U Drive"" should pop up. Single click (important) on U drive.6) Wait for a couple of minutes - it takes time to load and I was sure it was not working the first few times I tried it because I did not wait long enough. The first file menu that pops up is for the phone, when a second longer menu appears you will be able to use the Overdrive transfer option from your computer to get the files on to your phone.These steps were from my Windows 7 computer.Other things I like:The calendar with audio reminders of my appointments.The keyboard that I find easy to use in spite of the tiny keys. Maybe it works because the keys are raised. The numbers are small, but since most of the phone numbers I call are stored, I rarely have to enter a phone number.",24.0,3

Not a huge deal as I have a million charging cables laying around. 2nd, this is not a GSM unlocked device. If using a service that uses GSM radio waves such as AT&T, T-Mobile or Tracfone be sure to ask for a CDMA sim card or you will not be able to make or send texts (although you'll be able to receive them...how frustrating.)

(downloaded mymail app)I'm still finding my way around this phone but overall it's a decent phone for the price. It doesn't have every bell and whistle, but has enough to get the job done.

"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,971.6,5,"Just received the phone today. I've had a BLU phone before and knew I'd get a great device for an affordable price. The dual SIM feature is a bonus for me as we are considering switching from T-Mobile to Cricket because of coverage. Of course one problem with any non T-Mo phone (other than an iPhone with iOS 8) is that there is no Wi-Fi calling to fall back on. So far my T-Mo coverage actually seems better, though I haven't had a good chance to try out everywhere yet.One issue I've found is that the product description states this phone can handle a 64 GB MicroSD card so I purchased one and gave my 32 GB card to a friend after backing up my data. When I opened the shipping box, the back of the phone box says it can use up to a 32 GB card. I went ahead and copied my data to the new card, but the phone will not recognize it.As some have mentioned, data use can be an issue. I haven't studied it yet but it appears that SIM 1 is the full speed LTE slot, so you want the SIM with your best data package there. One thing to note, however, is that in my case I can only run the Cricket SIM in SIM 1. I have more data on T-Mo, but the Cricket SIM refuses to connect at all if it is in SIM 2. The T-Mo card works in either one, but it can only find 2G data when installed in SIM 2. I'm planing to visit a friend this weekend so I may try to swing by a Cricket shop and see if they have any advice.So far I would say that the pros are the screen, Dual SIM slots, included accessories, and the signal strength. Cons would include the misleading product description regarding max SD card size here (though BLU's site and the product box agree with each other about a 32 GB max) and the SIM slot idiosyncrasies and current lack of information on how to properly set them up.All in all, it's a fine device and well worth the money. Depending on your cellular provider, though, you may need to take it into a store or call customer service to get everything working properly.I haven't even had it for an entire day so I will update with more information as I can test it out better.",146.0,4

This one, the J7, is a keeper. I can't see anything negative about it so far.Appearance: looks great, perfect 5.5"" basic HD display. Because it's plastic rather than metal, it's not heavy. It's very slim so can fit nicely in your pocket or small handbag.Performance: finally a phone that pairs and keeps Bluetooth connection, rather than drops it after 10 minutes (which plagues many Android 5.1 devices). Reception seems fine, not better or worse than other phones, my signal showing around -73, the same as other phones. Call quality was perfect, clear, loud on speakerphone, and the other party had no difficulty hearing me either. It has been documented that plastic phones are better than metal when it comes to signal. As I look for a phone that works well as a ""phone"" rather than everything but, signal and call quality are super important to me.Camera: can't go wrong with 13 mp back camera. Clear, sharp photos that you can edit with the help of many photo apps out there. And because of the nice, crisp screen, your photos look good.Battery: 3000 mAh seem to last forever. It comsumes Zero power at night on standby. Charged it to 100% before going to bed and in the morning it's still 100%.I like the fact that is has a micro sim (2 slots) rather than the invisible nano, which I will probably lose within 2 seconds of handling it never to be found. Huge expansion storage on micro sd card, which cleverly slides on top of sim 1 to save space.My phone was purchased ""used, like new"" from JP Mobiles, arrived very fast, as new looking as can be. It was a little over $200, which is great price for a fantastic phone, when you think that people shell out a thousand bucks for a phone that may not be any better than this one.",18.0,4

Although the Mediapad doesn't offer image stabilization, the video quality is very clear, and the display is gorgeous. So far it's been easy to use, has good speakers, and is a real bargain at under $400. I currently have a 128GB removable SD card.

I was shocked that so high priced of phone wouldn't offer 4g to begin with, and I have to deduct a star on that alone. I have to say though that the phone is a lot better in responsiveness to my old LG Optimus G Pro, and I am really in love with it overall, except for the lack of 4G. :(I really love the size of the phone, and I also love the fact that I am not accidentally opening apps and the home screen every time I pick it up or put into my pocket.... the Optimus G Pro was absolutely a nightmare when it came to this and I got tired of it.I highly recommend this phone to anyone who does a lot of social networking and picture taking ,as there are plenty of apps for that already installed on the phone. The pictures that you can take with this phone are gorgeous, and I think any enthusiast would be pleased to have it.The only knock I have with the phone is that the battery life could be a lot better in my opinion, which might boil down to a software issue that perhaps Sony can fix in the future.If you look at the reviews and benchmarks on this phone concerning battery life, you will see that it has a higher battery life than most all other phones in talk time, but falls way short in web browsing and watching videos, and I can see that for myself using it to verify it.I hope that for those looking to enjoy 4G on this phone with the TMobile and ATT network will not make the same mistake I made in getting the C6902 model ,and find this review helpful",25.0,4

"Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",Nokia,193.5,5,"My wife and I both got new unlocked Nokia's a few weeks ago. I love this phone. It replaces a Motorola Razor V3 and my Palm T3. This phone is beautiful and metal! The screen is very easy to read even out in daylight ( I always had trouble with my Motorola in the sun). There are a few functions I have not yet been able to get working yet (primarily Internet phone) but everything is easy to set up. I found an app from StyleTap that allows me to use most of the apps I had on my Palm T3. This alllows me to use many of those apps on my phone, especially the data bases I have set up, and many neat games. Of course I can't use a stylus, but that has not been too much of a problem. My T3 needs mechanical repair and won't let me make stylus input anyway. One thing I really like about the Nokia is the ability to multitask, something the iPhone can't do. The phone works perfectly. Calls are clear and I have no contract remaining with AT&T so I was able to modify my current plan to include unlimited calls, messages, media messages and data for just $30 a month a $15 increase from the plan I was using for the Razor which allowed limited calling and data. If I had bought an iPhone under AT&T plan, I would have paid about the same for a locked iPhone, but a data only plan of $30 is required by AT&T for that phone. I get perfect 3G connections and I am also able to connect to my home network and other WiFi networks with a few clicks of the keypad. The keypad is small, but full QUERTY. I hated texting on the Razor but really like it on the Nokia. I have figured out how to get my big hands to work the tiny keys. The camera is easy to use and takes better pictures than my Razor did. This phone even has an FM radio! So in summary, this phone is fully customizable, has clear voice and is a great geeky smart phone.",2.0,4

You will not be sorry you read my Review. I researched this S. Phone, and found its specs very impressive. It took me all but 3hrs. with it before I knew this was it, The One! What caught my eye in the specs before I got it, was the 8GB Internal Memory it has. A problem with most S. Phones, most only with 2-4 GB Internal Mem. I use a lot of Apps, and it didnât take long to fill the Storage up. I thought Iâd use the SD Expansion to take the Apps I couldnât fit on the Internal Mem., but to my disappointment, the SD Card didnât accept most of the Apps for some reason. I have 32 GB SD Mem. in my BLU Life 8, and it let me transfer a lot of the Apps, keeping my Internal Mem. Hardly used. I love it. Its 4core CPU, 1 GB of RAM is not Joke. That leads me to the HD Screen Quality & 5.5â View of my Videos. Its 4G supported and Iâm getting it. It has Hotspot which lets my get Wi-Fi on my tablet if I need it. It seems they did some Improvements on the Voice & Speaker Phone since my BLU Studio. So in short; itâs FAST, has a Brilliant HD Screen, plenty of Storage, 4G Capable, & letâs not forget a SHARP 8mp front Camera & a HIGH Capacity Battery.

And, if my cheek brushed the screen on other voicemail systems, it would activate a number on the screen causing the message to be deleted, passed, saved, etc.So I paid retail to my provider (GCI) for my next phone, an Alcatel qwerty candybar style phone. Although I wanted a non-touchscreen phone, GCI only sells GSM texters that have touchscreen menu systems even if they have hard keys for texting and dialing. This phone had a better locking scheme than the Samsung but it too was regularly defeated in my pocket (but it did not make spurious 911 calls).Both the Samsung and Alcatel are of high quality but I hate them for their touchscreens.So...A couple of months ago I bought the unlocked Nokia C3-00 phone from Amazon. It is a dream compared to my other phones. The radio has far better FM reception than the Samsung or Alcatel; the battery lasts WAY longer than my past phones; the menu system is natural, better designed, and faster than the touchscreens; the keypad is easy to see and has a very good touch; the screen quality is bright and clear; and the phone STAYS locked when you lock it. Call quality is excellent. WiFi is easy and fast, and I remain happy not to spend an extra $30 per month (PLUS data plan cost) to have a smart phone.Two teensy cons for me with this phone, both cheaply resolved:(1) The back of body of this solidly built phone is slick. I don't want the phone falling out of my breast pocket or my hand so I ordered from Amazon ""Amzer Silicone Skin Jelly Case for Nokia C3 - Black by Amzer"" for about $10. The case slips on perfectly and keeps the phone comfortably secure while I am on a call; and it keeps the phone in one place no matter where I put it down. It also muffles the Nokia's enthusiastic vibration when I want to be alerted to a call or text but don't want to buzz the desktop.(2) The sound quality of the comfortable and ergonomically well-designed earbuds is muffled-sounding. So I simply substitute the original earbuds from an old iPod. They are sufficient for providing the Nokia's superior FM reception and they sound better than the Nokia buds.When my cell phone contract comes up in a couple of months I will take a free phone if I can get the little Samsung ruggedized waterproof phone for when I'm camping or fishing. But I will keep using the Nokia C3-00 as my primary phone beause it is perfect for my normal pattern of phone usage.",1.0,4

Please know both my teenagers phone were previously insured, but I have since dropped insurance coverage seeing you have a broad selection of phones at a better value than the insurance deductible. Also, insurance does not cover water damage. I don't understand why consider most damage is either dropped/cracked or water damage. The insurance deductible is $50 per phone while each of these phones were $35. You also get to CHOOSE a different type of phone and the phone is NEW (your insurance carrier will send you a refurbished phone).I gave 4 stars because my teenagers do not like the menu. After using the device, I agree. The menu/buttons are in excess and somewhat complicated. I can affirm 2 things: talk and text features work like a charm. I enjoy how the text screen is formatted and I enjoy the selection of ring tones. This phone is just as good, if not better, than any phone you will get from AT&T.

Nokia Lumia 635 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8.1 Quad-Core Phone - White,Nokia,99.95,4,"I don't know whether this phone is truly unlocked because I didn't have another provider's sim to try. I'm on an ATT network anyway so my sim was good to go. I like the Windows platform... better than Android, it seems more stable and more organized. This is an entry level phone but it does all I need a device to do at this point in my life. I gave up a lot of flashy hardware extras, and some software extras by making this move backwards. My only regret is the lack of apps that allow more control over personalizing the phone's use. This model doesn't support an automatic power on/off ... or a gravity or proximity sensor sleep/wake for the screen. It doesn't support the double tap screen ""wake up"" either. I will be using the power button a lot more than I had to with the newer Androids, and I wish Windows or Nokia would update the hardware controls to offer those features. Otherwise, the 635 is sturdy, lightweight, the right size, and I don't miss not having an led flash because the camera takes decent pix without one. I find Cortana a little dense at times, but we're getting along okay. I wish Nokia would put a voice microphone on the keyboard, independent of Cortana, for those of us who like to dictate text rather than type. Bottom line, it's a real nice phone, but not a great one. I don't do email or social media, or play action games on it... it's basically my phone and information highway",54.0,4

Motorola Moto G LTE- Factory Unlocked US Warranty (Black),,108.0,5,"I had to sell my iPhone 5 and wanted to replace it with another cheaper new smart phone.I was attracted to the original Moto G because of it's design by Motorola and the stock AndroidROM being fairly clutter free since it was coming from when Google owned Motorola. The sameis true for the Moto G LTE, which addressed the two reasons I didn't buy the original model: It nowhas LTE (and supports 2G/3G/HSPA) and a MicroSD card slot, both which are great, though I don'tlive in an area currently covered by LTE so I can't confirm, but the speeds are the same if not slightlyfaster than my iPhone 5.The phone itself is pretty and sleek.

With this phone, I am not able to play music, smoothly from Tune In as once before. The issue starts whenever I have Wifi and Carrier service on at the same time. Never a problem with prior.GMaps + Music - Normally, I could listen to music while getting directions from GMaps. With this phone, every turn-by-turn direction causes my music to stop completely and I have to press play in order to start the music again. Never a problem with prior.Home Double-Tap Button - When I attempt to use this feature to navigate through opened apps, it would work about 1 out of 5 tries. Never a problem with prior.Wifi On/Off - Normally, I could turn my wifi on/off, interchangeably, between use with apps and never had a problem; however, apps recognize that the wifi is off and only consider this the designated source for data transfer. To fix, I've had to turn the phone off completely for it to refresh. Never a problem with prior.I am currently in the process of returning this phone, for they have a 90 Day Return policy.

OtterBox Defender Series Case for Apple iPhone 6 Plus - Ink Blot,,24.99,3,"I purchased the Otterbox Defender case for my iPhone 6 Plus and found the problem described by many that the screen protector does not sit flat on the screen and causes problems with the touch screen. I called Otterbox and they said they fixed the problem and I could either deal with the original seller or I could get a free replacement from Otterbox but would be charged shipping. In order to make sure I got the latest version I opted for the getting it from Otterbox. As others have found out, the new version had the same problem. After reading about others ripping on the screen protector and moving on, I decided to do the same. I purchased the Mikasa Tech Tempered Glass screen protector for iPhone 6 plus and it installed easily. I cut out the screen protector from the Otterbox and it works great!!! I think the screen protector is way better and cleared than the Otterbox. So I am happy with the protection of the Otterbox Defender and the Holster and the built in stand and the Mikasa screen protectection.That is good for 3 stars for Otterbox",0.0,4

It gets great reception, even better than my old V3 RAZR, which I thought had excellent reception. Call quality is also very good.I love the touchscreen! I won't go back to a non-touchscreen phone after this. It's so much easier to navigate through the menus and get it to do what I want. Yes, texting is a little more difficult. But, all the positives of the touchscreen outweigh that negative. And, I text quite a bit.I have At&T in the U.S. and I was able to get MMS and internet services to work right away. Just do a Google search for LG Cookie MMS settings AT&T. There is a lot of info out there on how to set it up.The phone is very thin and lightweight. I wear jeans a lot and it fits in the front pocket nicely.So, if you don't need 3G, GPS, or WiFi, this is a really great phone. If you do, then I'd look elsewhere.

Samsung Galaxy S Duos II S7582 DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked International Version - Black,Samsung,299.99,5,"OK, so this is my first smartphone, and my needs are simple. Phone, web access, email. Nothing special or elaborate. And the phone works great. I specifically wanted a small phone to fix my little hands, and this is just perfect. Yes, the keypad is a little tight, but I've learned to deal with it, and the word prediction is fabulous.My cellphone service provider had to help me set up the connectivity, as it is an unlocked phone so the settings weren't pre-entered, and it's worked well since then. I'm thrilled that the dual SIM works, as I love being able to use the phone throughout Europe without removing my US SIM card and trying not to lose it. It seems fast and responsive to me, although the paper manual did NOT tell me how to answer the phone which I found extremely frustrating... then of course I found the answer on the Web.The Manual that I found amongst the apps was really helpful, and it would've been nice if the useless paper manual had pointed me to it. (I certainly couldn't find a manual at Samsung's website which surprised me no end.) I had learned how to deal with the wonders of Android when I bought my tablet 2 years ago, which made this whole experience a bit easier than it would've been otherwise. It's ability to scan and connect to wifi is wonderful, and it frequently points me to open wifi sites I'd be otherwise unaware of.

BLU Tank II T193 Unlocked GSM Dual-SIM Cell Phone w/ Camera and 1900 mAh Big Battery - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - Black Blue,BLU,18.93,5,"Great little phone. Got this for teenage son for first phone. Does the job. Is unlocked, used with T-Mobile prepaid. No issues at set up. Does have dual SIM (at least the blue one did). Can use business number on one SIM and personal number on other SIM. Doesn't fit my needs but thought I'd mention it. Battery is nice and long. No decent instructions come with it so just takes time to figure everything out. Can lock the keypad by pressing the top left corner control button and the ""*"" key. However this doesn't prevent the phone from shutting off if the power button is held down. I don't like that fact but it's the only real complaint j have. The radio works well and my son has managed to get music on a mini SD card loaded into the phone so it acts as an MP3. Has a camera, but he and I do not believe you can send or receive photos (at least we haven't been able to). Durable little phone, my son is clumsy and drops things a lot so this one has held up for a month so far with no issue. No internet access on this phone (this was the whole reason we purchased it). Did not feel 13 yr old should have access to the entire world in the palm of hand. Lot of responsibility there and with this generations focus to validate self through social media, waned to keep his focus on his real life accomplishments and face to face interactions with friends. He will go through those motions on his own as all teens push for that freedoms and experience. Be for now, while he is still on the younger side of teenage years, this phone works wonderfully for us. P.S. My son has taken our encouragement to be fun with his ""outdated"" type phone in school and often makes remark as it is his Stone Age phone, enticing humor amongst his peers. He says he doesn't mind it being outdated and even likes that it's a little sturdier than his friends. (Of course he does dream for an iPhone but just thought I'd mention it in case any other parents out there were in the same place I was and worried your child might hate you for an outdated phone. They won't, they know you love them and are thinking in their best interest. It shows.) Hope this review details enough for any type I future buyer.",15.0,4

"Sony Xperia XA unlocked smartphone,16GB Black (US Warranty)",,249.99,5,"A wonderful phone!! Much better than I had anticipated!! I was so tired of getting left behind by Microsoft. After 5+ years on Windows Phone I decided to switch to Android. I borrowed my wife's iPhone for a day or two and it was ok but not much customization available. I had messed around with several cheap Androids just for fun over the years, I loved the fact that they were easy to customize and reminded me of my old beloved Symbian OS! I also found that with Android the hardware selection was amazing. on Windows we only had Nokia and as of late Microsoft and Asus phones available. I saw this Sony XA at Best Buy. I researched it and felt it might be a solid phone, especially at that price. I had to order from Amazon because I wanted Lime Gold. I now have the phone and it is NOT sluggish at all. The battery is pretty good and the screen is wonderful. It may not have the highest resolution screen but it is very clear and bright and the colors really stand out. The camera is not bad either, especially in low light. I am pleasantly surprised by this phone. Well done Sony, and thanks Amazon for carrying this phone in the color that I wanted at a very good price. Best mid-range phone out there. Feels much closer to premium!",5.0,4

"CNPGDÂ® All-in-1 Smartwatch+GSM Watch Cell Phone, with FM, MP3/4, Voice recorder (Black)",CNPGD,29.99,5,"Update: 4-6-2016TL;DR: Upgrading to 5 stars. This is a great watch for the money. CNPGD did a great job once again. If you want a sharp looking round-face design smart watch on the cheap, then this is a very solid build with excellent screen and feature set. You might need a different app for Android 5.0+ than what it comes with. Dig below for the app description.UPDATE: Take the time to install the right app. There is no way this is a 2 star smart watch unless you are expecting it to have a feature set other than what it actually is: a smart watch. It's not a phone watch, it's not a hybrid calling watch, it's just a fantastic little smart watch.By request - ALL the details:This watch has a lot going for it, with a couple of nit-picky cons. Let's start out with my device specs: UPDATE: Phone switch to - Digital Reign Journey Phablet with Android KitKat. Keep this in mind during the following information regarding the app, etc.# First thing is ... the mobile app that goes with the watch. It has a QR code built into the watch. Scan it and grab the app. Very nice looking app. I found one I like even better called ""TRULY SmartDevice"" - it is nearly identical in appearance and functionality, plus it works perfectly with the watch using my phone/tablet. If the scanned app doesn't work for you, go grab the one I mentioned and you will be all set. 100% all notifications push for the Android. I do not own Apple products to test for you sorry. Also, this app has a 'scan' feature. If you have trouble using in combo with a headset, just check on Scan, and choose your watch. Probably got switched to your headset when it connected. Done.UPDATE: TRULY SmartDevice app allows the install of weather applet. Works great. Wish there were more applets!# Construction of this watch is top notch. Metal housing, plastic back and face/screen, and magnetic charger make this look and feel first rate. Lots of compliments in the first two days of wear. Not a flawed bevel or 'squeezable' creaky seam to be found.UPDATE: I have really put this poor thing through its paces lately and it has stood up to some real abuse. Heavy rain, got beaten against a door frame several times hauling equipment around, wasn't paying attention scrubbing up and completely doused it in the sink (at which point it powered off by itself and I thought I had fried it! Dried it off and it has worked ever since.), etc. Still works like a champ.# Bluetooth connectivity is great. What's that mean? I mean it is solid. Stable. Great range. Freaky range actually. I have a PLT_Legend Headset which has amazing range, and I will hear 'beep... phone 1 disconnected' right before I start feeling my wrist vibrate to warn me it is losing signal. Works great with headsets by the way.# Charged this on the first day in about 1.5 hours from 'low battery' warning to full charge. I have been playing around with it quite a bit, playing music, taking and making calls with it for fun, and I get a LOT of messages, emails, skype, case notifications via specialized apps, etc. as a contractor just in regular use.UPDATE: I am changing this to an average of 3 days. You will get anywhere from 2 to 4+ days depending on how much it gets used. Really, it is up to you how much life you get out of it, but either way - you'll never have to worry about battery life. It's incredible.# No battery draining extras. This is what it is: A Smart Watch. No SIM card slot, No TF slot, nothing. Just give you notifications and has a few nice apps like Pedometer and such that seem to work ok. I've tested it all (aside from 'Siri' since I don't own Apple stoofs) and it all appears to work as it should.# Sound is simply fantastic. If CNPGD is good at anything - this seems to be it. Louder than any name brand watch I've messed with, crystal clear, and music reproduction is pretty amazing. Outright enjoyable to listen to in fact. Microphone works well according to the several people I tested it with.# The wristband is very nice quality. The underside is an almost suede texture making it very comfortable to wear, but read on to see one nit-pick that you should know about below.-> Lastly, there are a couple of things you should know before buying just in case any of these might be a deal breaker for you:# If you have large wrists, you will have to buy a longer wristband. I have what I would consider medium to even smallish wrists for a man. I am using the *last* hole on the band and I mean it is exactly comfortable. Any shorter and I wouldn't be able to wear it.UPDATE: Most moto360 bands can be modified to use with this. Leather bands are super easy to just widen the gap a bit. Metal bands are pretty simple to just use band itself and set pins - most of the link gaps are wide enough.# If you are partial to a digital display (i.e. large numbers displayed like 12:15 PM instead of an analog clock) then this will not work for you. There are 5 different watch faces, all of them are nice in their own way and a couple of them are downright amazing. However I am surprised there is no 'digital watch' option for viewing the time. Keep this in mind when ordering.UPDATE: This remains my only gripe, although it is not an issue since a couple of the faces I really like as it is.Overall, I am really enjoying this watch so far and will give regular updates as time goes on just as I did with my previous CNPGD watch. I will miss it dearly as it served me without fail for over a year's brutal abuse by my person. It's final accidental crunch under my foot gives way to this new adventure.UPDATE: So far this watch is every bit the gem my previous model was. I'm really on board with CNPGD products at this point. Bang for your buck, this is hard to beat.",6.0,4

LG Google Nexus 5 D820 Black 32GB GSM Unlocked (Certified Refurbished),LG,179.99,5,"I purchased the phone refurbished from ""Blue Tech Certified"" via Amazon when I was ready to toss my Windows phone out the window (the phone was solid, but there's about 5 apps that are useful on it and that's it). I did some research on similar phones, and for the money this had enough of the features I wanted and positive reviews on Amazon and other sites. The phone arrived with protective plastic coatings on the front, back and key points on the sides. The charger it came with has a fairly cheap generic one that seemed to get exceeding warm while charging and started smelling of burning plastic, but I had several other chargers to fall back on. Besides, I bought a phone; they had to send a charger along as a semi-necessity, and I wasn't expecting to get a free $60 charger with my $150 phone. I couldn't find any issues with the screen, casing or buttons. I was a little worried that the battery wasn't working perfectly, but after a night's charge it was working fine. I swapped my AT&T SIM card pretty easily from my old phone to the new one, and it found the AT&T network quickly without any hassles. It took a couple hours to catch every upgrade, but it was up to v6 in a reasonable time. It's been at least 5 years since I had an Android phone so it'll take some time to get used to the settings & features, but all in all I'm very satisfied so far.",0.0,4

My music app starts to play by itself out of blue, which gave me couple of embarrassing moments during meetings.Then the screen cracked. Well, that was my fault. I fixed that by spending 170 dollars more on this stupid phone. And then the front camera is broken. Just to make a double down, my text function starts to fail.

But I was not looking to sign up for a new two year contract with AT&T. I am retired and stay at home most of the time...the cell phone is not used that much...as a matter of fact, I have 5000 unused rollover minutes at the present. I would not make much use of a smartphone, and I certainly didn't want the extra cost that AT&T charges for the their data and messaging plans. But I did want to be able to send text messages to the kids if necessary and the old phone did not have a qwerty keyboard and as an old man, I couldn't negotiate the old style keyboard very well. So I was looking for an unlocked Phone that would work on the AT&T network and that had a qwerty keyboard. The Nokia C3 fit my needs perfectly. And so far, it seems to be of excellent quality...I have always had good results with Nokia and this one is no exception. The voice quality is great.

Studio 7.0 LTE - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - Gold,BLU,,4,"I have a love hate relationship with this phone. It's really big! It's nice to do things on cuz of the size but it's just too big to put anywhere. There are no cases that I have really found for it. I ordered a case and it's the size of a tablet case with a skinnier slot for the phone to fit in. It is really awkward to have to pull out a tablet case and talk on it when u are walking around the grocery store. The lock button is easily pressed and when held down shuts off the phone. I have had it in my purse and get pressed and my phone shuts off without me knowing. This phone has to be rebooted daily or the phone starts freezing up and running really slow. Twice my phones screen has turned black and no buttons worked. I held down the power a couple of times and eventually it restarts and works again. I do not always get the texts people send me. I believe that is because of the phone and not my service because that never happened with my other phone. Overall it is not a bad phone though. It does what it is supposed to and I have only had these problems a few times. Just enough to be annoying but not enough for me to say it's a bad phone. You get what u pay for. It's a cheap phone and there is no way it is going to be a great as an iPhone or a Samsung. My favorite things about this phone are: the screen is very bright, the camera quality is pretty good on this phone, the volume on this phone is great compared to other blu phones, it's perfect size for watching movies or reading Kindle books.

If I break it tomorrow, I will be online buying another from them.",1.0,4

Sony Xperia E C1504 Unlocked Android Phone--U.S. Warranty (White),Sony,34.99,3,"I popped my GoPhone (AT&T) SIM with the $35 plan into this when I got it and it worked right off the bat, no issues whatsoever. I opted to turn off data and simply use wifi for all of my internet needs. The only problem I had upon unboxing it was figuring out how to get the battery cover off, as the instructions are mostly just pictures and not very descriptive - I figured out that what you do is simply put your thumbs above the little speaker on the back and push up.People who are used to more powerful, more expensive phones might be a little disappointed. I previously had a phone that ran Android 2.2 and really wanted a phone that would support my credit union's app which allows me to take pictures of checks to deposit them (otherwise I have to drive 2+ hours) and this phone does that perfectly, even with the low-grade camera.I love the ""swiping"" option with the keyboard, I find it to be much easier to text that way, especially if I need to text with one hand. (No, not while driving).UPDATE 8/31/14: I had to knock off a couple points after having this phone for awhile. It lags and freezes up a lot. It will freeze, the screen will lock after 30 seconds, and then it will just not respond for awhile. You either have to pop the battery out and completely restart it or wait for it to get itself together. Certain apps seem to be the cause. Snapchat and Vine have so far been unsuccessful for me, they don't record video and cause the phone to freeze. Shazam works but takes FOREVER and sometimes causes the phone to freeze. A lot of games that I've downloaded are also pretty much unplayable due to the lagging, like Dots, Piano Tiles, and Temple Run. The Walkman app sometimes locks up too, it won't stop playing music but just won't respond when you press buttons.Apps that I have NOT had a problem with on this phone are Facebook, Pinterest, Pandora, Tumblr, Facebook Messenger, Indeed, Dropbox, Discover Mobile, Opera Mini, and Google Maps. I have to say, this phone is incredibly reliable when using it as a GPS with Google Maps.The microphone on the phone also stopped working for me this summer. I don't know if other people have had any issues with that, but I didn't take any points off because it's hard to tell if it was caused by something I did or not. I have gotten the phone wet and dropped it before. At first I just sounded really far away to people and then they weren't able to hear me at all and would just hang up on me. Now the only way I can make calls is with the headset, which, on the bright side, works great.Overall, I think there are other phones out there at this price that probably perform better.",,4

BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold,BLU,134.95,5,"MADE IN THE USA!!! Absolutely AMAZING performance, beats phones that cost twice as much EASILY! I was hesitant to get it at first, I'd had a Sony Experia (and a few Droids before then), did NOT want to have a dorky ""holster"". I liked being able to just put it in my pocket, but then I realized, well, I rarely put my phone in my pocket, unless I'm not carrying my purse. Even then, they now make cross shoulder 'purses' and wristlets for women for 'phablets'. Anyway, every single time I've bought a phone, I wanted it to have a great camera. Well this DOES! 24mp front and 8mp rear. AND, takes videos in HD, the very first time ever I've been able to capture my son playing sports both in video and pics in action, any lighting and clearly. It takes FANTASTIC photos!!!Battery life-well, I can stream music, play a few online games, surf for a day without it needing to recharge.BIG beautiful 6"" HD screen!!! Again, i was really hesitant to get it because of the size, but geez, why do most of us get ""smartphones"" to begin with?? NOT for making calls (if that was the case, we'd all still just have simple flip phones) but for surfing the web, playing games, taking pics, doing things we now do on our PCs at home, etc. My former phone only had a 4.5"" screen, couldn't see a dang thing on it, couldn't play games, barely see anything, took just 'okay' pics, very slow, weak signal, but I could put it in my pocket. With this phone, I can surf, watch videos, play games so much easier while waiting for anything or on my break at work.Hello?? 3gb RAM, 64 gig built in storage with a 2.2mhz OCTACORE (8) processor. This baby is FAST!! Youtube videos, music and very graphic intensive games have almost NO lag for buffering, from start to finish. (NOTE: I did try to install an additional SD card, which I really didn't need, but the phone never recognized it?)The screen is BEAUTIFUL!! And large enough to actually watch videos, movies, play games easily AND even share the view with someone else. Very responsive as well, plus there's even a setting for 'gloves'.Additionally, this phone offers functions like simply clicking on a contact, holding the phone to your ear and it will dial that person. Or, simply hold your phone to your ear to answer calls. It also has an auto/hands free 'sleep/wake' function that you can wave your hand over it to wake it, move your home screens, and it will automatically sleep when you put it in your pocket or purse. (I didn't catch this at first, would put my phone to 'sleep', put it in my purse and it would immediately light up/be on-as in, it was sensing the motion of going into my purse as a hands free wakeup gesture. Now, had i known, just putting it in my purse would've put it to sleep.)Great signal. My son can play Internet games on it during long road trips, no reduction in performance, only a very rare few second ""stall' in certain dead zones (that's my carrier, not the phone's issue).The sound is fantastic, the first phone EVER that I can actually HEAR ringing (I'd had Droids prior to my last phone). It has a large rear speaker and amazing sound quality on it's own, but even better through headphones or external speaker. It has a built in sound enhancer for listening through headphones, but I haven't ever done that yet. I have a bluetooth soundbar, I can connect this to it, stream music via the Internet and it's just amazing.It does have 'fingerprint recognition' unlock technology and a sensor on the back, but i'm a little hesitant to use it since I've seen a few reviews saying it was a little 'iffy"".Not sure how you could override it to unlock it if it doesn't recognize your fingerprint.This comes with a clear silicon case, a gold 'flip case', fast charger (it can go from 30% to full within 30 min), earbuds and a screen protector.Downside? Well, it sounds dumb, but their 'launcher' did away with the app drawer (the button you can usually click to see all of your apps, sort them, etc). So, every single app has it's own shortcut added to whichever screen you're on. Sure, you can make folders and stuff, but sometimes you forget about apps, NOT easy to get to them at all (gee, I've had my phone for over a month and can't really tell you how to get to them, but I have).It's extremely difficult to change settings on the phone because they're buried in multiple places.",4.0,0

The screen is small, even smaller with all the stuff they pack into it. I also really struggle with the poor interface and the way most other phones function now that the iPhone exists. Either it's a smart phone or it isn't, and when you try to be both the user experience suffers.

I would give this phone 5 stars but I would more give it 4.5 stars but since there is no 1/2 star I will give it 5 starts for the following reasons1. I owned the BLU Vivo 5 and by FAR it is the best BLU phone ever made (even though it came from Gionee) for the price of $200. The value on the Vivo 5 is just incredible for the specs2. For the extra $100 over the Vivo 5 you get double internal memory and another 1 GB of RAM. You also get 3 more MP on the back and front cameras. Not too sure this makes much of a difference in picture quality. Will see after a few shots.. Would love to see BLU get up to Samsung quality with their cameras though. Of course too you get the finger print reader which is ""nice"".3. The Vivo 5 is a more attractive phone by far to me and I LOVED the all metal design. For me, I would more recommend someone to the Vivo 5. That is why it was selling out for MONTHS after launch. I doubt this one will.So overall.....if someone is looking for really good specs I would go for the Vivo 5. As you can see it is probably the best rated BLU phone that ever came out. I owned it and LOVED it for months after I got it. I decided to upgrade and who knows, I might regret but I need to have the latest since I own a electronics business (well doing that now).If you want to really show off to your friends that you have a TOP specs phone and got it for half the price they paid then go for the PURE XR!",9.0,4

So its not the fastest phone out there. It doesn't have a HD screen. You can't charge it wirelessly. It isn't waterproof. And you cant use it as a remote. Now that the unnecessary stuff is out of the way. This is the niftiest little phone you could ever have. It has all of the essential utilities you need for a phone: 3g/4g speeds on gsm carriers, WiFi, Bluetooth. It uses a micro USB charger, which be warned it uses an 8mm long tip which is approximately 2mm longer than a normal micro USB tip. So you can either get a new cable/ trim yours back so its like the included cable or you can trim back the plastic surrounding the port so that a normal Micro USB cable will fit. This phone has a tiny 650 mah battery, which sounds comical. In all honesty tho that battery will last you a day just like a 2500 mah battery would a regular smart phone. Yes the performance is NOT mind blowing. it only has 512 mb of ram and 4gb of on board storage, which is probably closer to 2gb due to android taking up space. These specs are horrible compared to flagships, obviously. It does have small lag spikes while using the device but the fact that i t runs android in the first pace is phenomenal. If you need a tiny phone, for any reason what so ever. GET THIS. whether it be to use it as a fitness device, mp3 player, or actual phone. This is well worth the money.

"Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini GT-I8200 Unlocked Cellphone, White, 8GB",Samsung,249.99,1,"The only reason to buy this phone is if your current cel broke and for whatever reason you can't upgrade to a replacement, you can't get the insurance to get you a new one, or you don't want to drop hundreds of dollars on a brand new handset.Do yourself a favor and get something else. You might think you're getting a proper s3 but you're not. Here's why:1) Brutally slow processor. As in, every app takes a second to load, draw the screen, and let you start using it. That doesn't sound like a lot ('one second? how bad can that be?') but imagine if EVERYTHING you do makes the phone work... one... second...... slower......... every........ time............... you..................................... use ............................................... it.....................................................................................................................2) Reception is crap. It's a mini, so there's no real antenna. Like to use your phone to talk? Forget it. Crackly and dropped calls, always.3) All apps work for crap. Native, google apps (such as maps, the only reason to get an android anyway) hang up, crash, won't start, and run so slow as to be unusable. I used to have a G1 and this phone's navigation is slower than that.4) Crap battery life. Half a day... and yes, I turned off EVERY SINGLE NON NECESSARY APP to reduce battery drain. Half a day is all you get.One good point: after the phone navigation got me lost 3 times in half an hour (in a 20 block radius) I smashed it repeatedly on the steering wheel and it didn't break. But, since it's a hundred dollar paperweight I wished it HAD broken. So, even the good stuff is kind of bad.Don't get this phone. If you get it for your kids or your grandma, their friends will make fun of them for having such a slow, crappy phone. Don't let your grandma's friends make fun of your grandma!P.S I'm looking at the other 5 star reviews for this phone. 90% of them are one word reviews ('excelente'), and all from South America. Everyone I know from South America has an iphone, for realz. Also, no one is gonna bother to log into Amazon to write a one-word review for a product they like... so, astro-turfing. Don't get this phone.",18.0,4

I am going to have to replace this phone because it's usually dead in an hour or 2.UPDATE: 02/15/2016To this date, this is the worst phone I've ever purchased. The battery life makes I impossible to use. it only last about an hour or so, and when its charging you cant use it without it draining the battery. I'm finally about to replace this phone.

Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Silver) - AT&T,Apple,43.95,3,"Had the phone for over 2 years now, there's been things that's changed my initial opinion. The phone is ok, it's not that great, at least into today's standard. The screen is too small, I always get complaints on how I can see this whenever I lend my friend to use it momentarily. The iOS has been supporting the iPhone quite sluggishly, it's not as snappy as it was the first day I purchased it. In every update it gets worse, at least after iOS 9. The camera is quite ok, it's fine for my use since I am not all that interested in taking pictures. Despite the horrible software it's been having recently, it's quite good. It's not as bad as the iPhone 4, it just works. What I most appreciate about this phone is the design, it's the last Apple iPhone device to have chamfered edges which I would miss if I upgraded. The camera doesn't protrude like the larger counterparts, it's design it's quite flawless. I would buy this phone currently again even though it's almost 3 years old. It's good phone though, hence today's standard, I view it as a basic phone with limited use due to hardware limit, and software caps.",0.0,4

Samsung S5830 Galaxy Ace - Unlocked Phone - Black,Samsung,89.99,2,"I ordered this phone on Saturday March 7, 2012 and was pretty excited as this was to be my first smart phone. I know that's funny even to me. I added next day delivery and got it on Monday as projected, so everything up until this point had been satisfactory. Opening the package, I found everything to be as it should be at first glance. However, when anyone drops this kind of money, they are going to do a thorough review of the product no matter what it is. Upon closer inspection of the box, I noticed that the language on the back of the box was in spanish but that is not what really stood out. What really stood out is the fact that it said the model number whas not an S5830L as ordered but instead it was an S5830M. I had researched this phone before purchase and was not familair with an M model. I though maybe it's just the box...Lol. Not a chance. I took the phone out of the box and took the back plate off to check the Samsung manufaturer sticker for the model and sure enough it was in fact a S5830M model. I thought, what could be the difference. I tossed in the battery and started it up. The native language on the phone was Spanish...LolOk, now I was concerned. Was this a knockoff or what? So I next called Samsung and gave them the S/N off of the sticker on the inside. The customer service rep told me that it came up as "" No Information Available"". The rep then told me that that was because it was not a model that they supported in the U.S. I asked, ok so what does that mean? The rep told me that this phone was not meant for sale in the U.S. and that there would be absolutely no support for it here! No warranty, nothing. Now let me say this. I switched the language setting in the phone over to English and tested the phone out. Everything seems to work as it should. It also has the latest platform for gingerbread 2.3.6 . The ICS platform (also called the Icecream Sandwich platform is not available at this time for the Galaxy Ace). So everything seemed to check out with the exception that if anything ever happens to this phone then I am just screwed...LolNext I called Amazon and gave them the information about the phone and what I was told by the phon's manufacturer Samsung. Amazon appologized up and down and extended a 20% refund as well as offered to replace it with a full refund within 30 days should something not work. They (Amazon) also told me that they were going to investigate the seller as well as the rest of the stock that they have on hand for this phone. I want to be clear that Amazon has been very helpfull in this matter in standing behind their site and customers. Today, I called the 3rd party seller that is selling this phone. They are out of New York. I talked to the manager and he said that the SKU numbers matched up with their product and that it had to be Amazon's fault. He went on to say that he would send me the correct phone if I would call Amazon and return the discount that Amazon gave me first. Now come on people, I didn't just get off the boat. I did tell him that I would be happy to give the discount back but I would have to have what I ordered first. No Way would I give it back first and then still be stuck with a phone that had no warranty and would not have any assistance for should something go south with it. He agreed and said that he would send me an email with the tracking number within the hour. Lo and behold, that hour came and went with no email.It just shows me that I was correct in my assumtion. In short, be careful and order from this merchant at your own risk. You are deffinately rolling the dice.Amazon still **ROCKS** though!",92.0,0

BLU PURE XR Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +4GB RAM - Gold,BLU,299.99,3,"The Pure XR is a smartphone that BLU claims will give you near flagship experience and for the most part I can tell you that they weren't too off base with that comment. The XR uses a Mediatek P10 processor that when paired with 4 GB of ram is actually not too bad to use. Managing through the custom skin that BLU calls Carefree launcher is smooth and overall a pleasant user experience that many potential iphone users will feel at home with. While we are far from a stock android device, some software features are actually more convenient the way BLU has it outlined. One of these is the relocation of the quick settings onto the bottom of the screen instead of the top like traditional android devices. Many Chinese OEMs do this and since this is a rebranding of a Gionee device, we get that here too. I'm not a huge fan of this tinkering of the settings layout but it grew on me and is actually much easier to access especially with a 5.5 inch device.Build quality is a mixed bag. While we do have an aluminum unibody, the quality of the build is questionable. When held next to other aluminum unibody phones like the OP3 or Axon 7, you notice a significant drop off in quality with the XR. This is accented by the flimsy buttons which are extremely loose and sensitive. At only $100 less than the other two stated phones, this is something that can be overlooked but not ignored in everyday use. I've noticed the volume rockers changing my ringer volume while resting in my pocket because the buttons are just so loose that brushing against my leg would be enough to confirm a click. And while the home button may annoy some due to the fact that simply shaking the phone can make the button emit a cheap loose shaking noise, we can't say the same about the embedded fingerprint scanner which is top notch. I am pleasantly surprised at how accurate this scanner is. Of all the phones I've used in 2016, while not the best, the Pure XR definitely trumps other more prominent phones such as the iPhone SE and Xperia Z5c when it comes to the fingerprint scanner.Everything else regarding the entertainment side of a smartphone is acceptable. The Amoled screen, while not quad hd, is very acceptable and enjoyable to look at with its Full HD display. Colors are rather vibrant and warm which if you've used Amoled before, you will be very happy with. You won't be getting the highest end performance as I've come across hiccups and force crashes here and there while playing games and using the camera, but for $299 I'm okay with the performance hit. I wish BLU could have squeezed the new X20 or an X10 in here over the P10, but at least they gave us 4 GB of ram which makes the P10 usable to say the least.Camera performance is lackluster which is to be expected here. Shots are slow to auto focus and miss almost every time even in good lighting. I've been taking a lot of photos that resulted in soft focus using auto focus on the Pure XR. Exposure also is not the best here. The back camera struggles to keep things in context to color and brightness. The selfie camera while decent in MP count also suffers similar problems to it's back camera counterpart.One of the special features this phone has that only 2 other phones have is what BLU calls 3D touch. Like Apple and Huawei, this is simply a marketing phrase for a display panel that has pressure sensitivity. There really isn't anything you can do with it at the moment other than the peak and pop feature that iPhone users have been accustomed to over the last year. Only a handful of system apps can use the feature and that is only if you are using the Carefree launcher. 3D touch is rendered moot if you download and use another launcher. But props nonetheless for the inclusion of this on a budget phone.One last huge positive to end this review. Battery life is terrific. I dare say that the choice not to use the power hungry SD processors have paid off as the BLU Pure XR has given me godly numbers. I struggle to kill the battery and I am a heavy power user. Whereas the OP3 only averages about 3-3 1/2 hrs of SOT, the XR has been giving me an astounding 5 1/2 - 6 hrs of SOT. I am very impressed.I have to conclude that if you can spend an extra $100 on a phone, you really need to look at the OP3 or Axon 7 as they are much superior for what you pay. But if you must buy a phone in the $299 range, then this is a solid buy. This phone goes to show that we as consumers have another option in the lower to mid end spectrum of the smartphone market which used to be flooded with unusable phones. What BLU has been doing this year with their devices is showcasing that while not flagship level, lower end devices can still offer glimpses of excellence where the user may question if they are using a $800+ phone.",66.0,3

"Nokia 5800 XpressMusic Unlocked Phone with U.S. 3G, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and 4 GB MicroSD Card--U.S. Version with Warranty (Black)",Nokia,79.0,3,"I'm writing this review from the perspective of an American who lives and travels overseas. Because of this, I was looking for an unlocked, quad-band GSM phone that had 3G, Wifi, GPS, a decent screen size for video and a good app selection. Plus, I wanted this all at a reasonable price since I would not be getting any plan subsidy. Using this criteria the 5800 seemed perfect and there are a lot of great things about this phone for the traveler which I'll go into later. The main negative I found was that the American version of this handset and the others in its product line do not support 3G outside of the Americas. The 5800 American edition does not support the UMTS (3G) 2100 frequency (Wikipedia has an entry under ""list of UMTS networks"" that show which carriers use which frequency). Now the point can be made that I bought American edition and shouldn't be surprised that it won't pick up 3G in other countries. The only problem is that almost all of Nokia's other American version 3G handsets like the N97, X6 and E75 (my wife's phone)do support the 2100 frequency. To be fair, the 5800 will support EDGE networks wherever you want to go and if you use a browser like opera mini, you may not even notice that much of a difference in general web browsing. It's just something to consider if you are looking at this as an international travel phone and a fast data connection is important to you.Now the 5800 does have some very nice features for the traveler that should be noted. First and foremost is the ability to pre-install free Ovi maps in your phone before you get on the plane. This allows you to use the 5800's GPS with voice directions without an active data connection. This is something that other free mapping services, like Google maps, cannot do. Of course you could go with third party software like Ndrive and pay up to $70 per map. Personally, I'll go with free. Of course with Nokia there is usually a catch. This one is that not every Nokia handset that has a GPS gets free Ovi maps. The 5800 does but my wife's E75, a phone released the same year and is much more expensive than the 5800, does not. If you are looking at other other Nokia phones and this feature is important to you, then check make sure the phone can use free Ovi maps.Another important travel feature is that the 5800 has Wifi. If you spend time overseas, you will probably be buying local pre-paid sim cards (the 5800's quad-band GSM capability lets you do that everywhere) with no or expensive data service. Therefore, Wifi is essential. Find a free hot spot at a coffee shop and you can check your email, tweet, update your Facebook and make Skype calls back home. The Nokia catch here is that connecting with Wifi can be a mysterious and confusing process. You would think that once you hook up to a Wifi connection then that the phone would automatically use that connection as the default. We'll you would be wrong. The first thing you need to do is go into all your applications that go online and insure that the default connection is set to ""always ask"". That way you can select the connection you want the app to use. If you don't then the 5800 may or may not use the free Wifi connection and instead drain the money out of your sim card without you noticing.As for long train, plane and automobile rides, the 5800 is a very decent media player. It has a standard 3.5mm audio jack and the music playback is very good quality. The screen is on the small side for video, coming in at 3.2 inches, but it is very high res at 360 by 640 and hence the video is sharp and clear. The screen is also in 16:9 widescreen format that means that the black bar problem on widescreen movies is not so noticeable. You will need to convert your videos to the MP4 format for the installed Real Player, but you would want to do that anyway to bring the file size down. Nokia also provides a generous 8 GB micro SD card, that can be upgraded to 16 GB. That means that right out of the box you can put a lot of media on the phone, without having to spend money on a bigger SD card.As for apps, the 5800 uses the S60V5 software and the phone has been out long enough that there are a fair amount of apps for the phone. You may have to dig for it, but pretty much everything I want the 5800 to do, and I want it to do a quite a lot, there is an app out there to let me do it. The difference with Apple and Android is that you may have 10 flavors of apps to do the 1 task you want, while with S60v5 you will probably only have one. The Nokia catch here is that S60V5 is a tough operating system to get to know and work with. It is not intuitive and can be initially very frustrating, but with time you get used to it's quirks and there's lot's of support on-line in different forums to help you learn the ropes.In the end I was looking for a phone that if I was traveling very light could do all the things a basic netbook could do. Despite it's lack of 3G outside North and South America, the 5800 does meet those expectations. With a small folding Bluetooth keyboard (The Iphone won't let you do that yet) and a battery backup charger (get one that uses either AA or AAA batteries so you can keep replacing the batteries)I can watch movies, listen to music, write long emails or notes and play games for all of my long haul flights and layovers. There is even an e-book app (ereader) that works pretty well if you bump the font up. Then when I finally do get to my destination, I can fire up the GPS and load a local sim card and I'm moving and communicating in no time. All this for a reasonable price without a contract.There is no question that Nokia delivers great hardware value with their handsets. The challange for Nokia will be to develop a operating system with plenty of apps that let's the user smoothly and easily take advantage of all that great hardware. With stores in the US selling $99 dollar 8GB IPhone 3GSs (with a two year contract), there is becoming less and less reason for folks to put up with Nokia's ""Quirks.""",6.0,4

"Apple Iphone 4 - 8gb Sprint (CDMA) White, Smartphone, in box with all the accessories, clean esn!!",,,5,"bought this sprint version of the iPhone 4 for forty bucks as a used but in ""good"" condition product from Amazon Warehouse Deals. put this on the sprint mvno RingPlus on the two-buck Joy plan and it works. the condition of the iphone is indeed ""good"" although at first glance it seemed ""very good"" until you looked carefully to see faint hairline scratches on the screen but they were really barely barely barely noticeable compared to other iphones purchased for myself and for family. the back panel had more noticeable scratches but that's normal and acceptable for a used iphone. easily replaceable with a new back. there were also some tiny nicks along the edges but they could be easily buffed out. preferrably you want at least a pristine flawless front screen when buying a used iphone that works, has fully working buttons, and is not icloud-locked and not suspended the carrier. other than the very faint hairline scratches on the screen this was a definite good purchase. very satisfied.FYI: this is like my ninth working used iphone puchased on amazon (3G, 3GS, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4S, 4S, 5) that were all good purchases. there was one other bad iphone (a 5) that was returned because the seller did not know what he was selling and was lying about its condition. so, myself personally have been mostly very lucky in buying used iphones on amazon and recommend that buyers scrutinize each seller's description and ratings when buying iphones.",1.0,0

"I9220(N9000) 5.0"" Capacitive Android 4.0 Dual SIM Smart Phone With 8GB ROM",Star,140.0,2,"I don't have all negative feelings about this phone or the seller I purchased from. But I have to say- more bad than good all things considered.First off: there seems to be a lack of consistency from phone to phone (more to the extent that people seem to be getting 2-3(+) different phones which are quite similar (seemingly clones), and have the same basic features on paper- but which are not identical (not the same model). At least that seems to be the most logical explanation to the various discrepancies between various other ""reviewers"".BUT, I would have to say that MOST importantly (for my phone at least): the phone does NOT have an 8GB ROM!!!The actual internal storage (for the ROM- operating system) is ridiculously small causing ALL sorts of problems for me. What it does have (or rather: what it did come with) is an 8GB microSD card.\A microSD card is NOT a/the ROM!!!My phone has no internal/built-in storage space/memory besides the tiny chip that the ROM/OS is installed on. I haven't been able to figure out exactly how big it is for sure- but according to the info in the settings: 76MB are being used and there's 80MB available- of internal storage space. So, if we just round that up to the nearest 10MBs...My phone only has 140MB of internal storage?!?!?! Are you kidding me?! I wonder how much RAM it's got?!Anyway, I'll add to this review at some point. But for now I just wanted to let people know not to actually expect 8GB of internal storage space (besides the fact that the microSD card does technically go ""inside the phone"".(That's one of the lines that the seller was trying to tell me to answer my question about the 8GB ROM. I'm no expert, but I do have a good working knowledge of the Android platform & devices.No matter who anyone tries to twist things all around- the microSD card is NOT the ROM. And one of the consequences of having to store everything on the microSD card (since the 80MB of free space left on the internal storage device is vastly insufficient) is that any defaults of any apps you've downloaded are reset every reboot. Any IMEs (keyboards) have to be re-enabled and then chosen again each time you reboot (or the battery dies- which often happens within several hours of being on STANDBY mode- NO usage of the phone at all!!!!)",2.0,0

Motorola Moto X 16GB (2nd Gen 2014) 3G - Black (SIM Free/Unlocked) UNLOCKED FACTORY,motorola,239.99,5,"There are thousands of reviews out there, so having switched from an iPhone 5 I will put the most significant differences I have experienced in my review:- No local account: I have the usual cloud email accounts, a business exchange account and my own personal information stored in MS Outlook. With the iPhone I was able to sync my Outlook contacts, calendar, notes, and tasks directly to the iPhone's ""local storage"" but this version of Android forced me to sycn with one of the accounts connected to an email service. I opted to go with my Exchange account rather than G-Mail or Outlook, but I would have preferred to have it all locally stored and synced directly from Outlook rather than through a 3-rd party.- Headsets: I make heavy usage of a 3-button headset. The Moto X does not natively play well with it. I am still trying out various headset controller apps, but it should not be this annoying: Sometimes moto voice and/or ""OK, Google"" will not work, Google Play Music continuously launches on its own, I cannot hang up or pick up calls from the headset buttons, volume does not work equally in all applications, etc.- Message display: Given that this might be just me whining about changes, but I drive a lot and preferred the iPhone temporarily displaying the entire message or email header on the phone screen rather than the ""battery'saving"" icon. I still have not fond a way of making it display entirely as I want. - Love the Moto assist features. Siri is a deaf, dumb and blind simpleton when it comes to voice recognition and helpfulness. I would have been happy even if I had gotten rid of Siri's ""just to confirm, you would..."", but the Moto voice recognition is getting so seamless that I now find myself talking to it as if it was a secretary, setting alarm clocks, making calendar appointments, texting people, etc.- Miss Facetime... Even with family and acquaintances I have had a hard time getting them to go with Google Hangouts. There is always Skype, but Facetime is being missed.Overall, I believe once I get past my ""the iPhone used to..."" phase I will be extremely happy with this phone and OS.",1.0,4

Easy to use with reading apps and easy to hold onto. Finger print scanner works great. NFC and android pay work great. Some of the pre-installed software is actually useful, such as Amazon App Store and the keyboard app has a number pad. Nice things included: silicon case, NFC marks to set up your own NFC commands, headphones like the iphone has. Big enough battery.

After reading forums, product reviews and doing comparisons, I jumped in to see what the hype was about.Let me start by saying this thing is smoking fast - it has a Snapdragon 810 chip set with 4 GB RAM, which means that flipping through screens, watching movies, playing with the camera/video and even gaming has been great. This is more memory than I had in my last device (LG G3) and it shows. I have not yet had a hang, stutter or anything. One reviewer mentioned the phone heating up. I personally have not experienced this in my usage and I have been throwing a lot of stuff at it. This thing is fast!I got the pfthalo blue color with gold trim and it is stunning. I receive comments on it regularly as it looks unlike most other boring black devices out there. The phone is metal and feels very solid - hard to believe that I paid what I did for it. It has a mono speaker but the volume is loud and sound is clear. I would have preferred stereo speakers but have used this for conference calls on speakerphone and it hasn't caused an issue yet. I get the impression that ZTE put a ton of effort into the Axon and it does indeed feel like a flagship offering with lots of attention paid to details, textures, components, etc. Just what I am looking for in a cool device that I want to use every day and feel good doing it.As a few other reviewers have noted, the camera on the Axon is excellent. It gives me great options like slow motion, multi-exposure, panorama, HDR, time lapse and more along with a bevy of manual f stop and camera controls if I want to tweak it to my experience. I can even adjust the depth of field AFTER my photo is taken, something that gives me a great look if I forget to adjust ahead of time. I did not notice any aberrations or color issues when I transferred them to my computer and blew them up. Video is sharp and fluid as well.It may sound trite, but the screen is just flat-out gorgeous. Great contrast, viewing angle, etc. - what everyone should be looking for. Colors were bright and accurate and everything I did on it looked great, from Netflix to web to games. Seriously, I am impressed with this screen. My wife's Samsung showed colors brighter but they were almost unnatural to a degree because of the OLED screen. I prefer realism, just as I intended when I take photos or watch movies.My Axon Pro came with 32GB memory but no microSD slot. At first I thought this may be an issue, but the more I thought about it, it's easiest just to back things up to the cloud or on my computer and when I looked at all the photos and music I already had loaded onto the phone, I still had tons of room left. So this is not an issue for me.I'll end by saying this has changed my entire outlook on ZTE as a company. I used to think of them for prepaid low-end phones over the years but the Axon changes everything. I have recommended this phone to family members and friends and I remind them that it does virtually everything their more expensive phones do but at a fraction of a price. I paid only $450 for all of this!Sorry, Samsung, I am done paying $800 (or more) for a phone - never again. Well done, ZTE! You've gained a new fan.",1.0,4

I instantly noticed that the phone would not stay charged and that it had to be turned off to charge. If I left the phone on while charging it would get extremely hot to the touch and warn me that the battery levels were critically hot and to shut off phone. So there for I had to start charging with it off. Also every tine I would take a picture the phone would just shut completely off. Basically it was junk. However it arrived quick & when I contacted The mobile dealers about my issues they were quick to handle it. They got me to send me the phone back with no questions & fully refunded me. So that was great of them. As far as the phone went.....I wouldn't recommend.,1.0,4

"Nokia E7-00 Unlocked GSM Phone with Touchscreen, QWERTY Keyboard, Easy E-mail Setup, GPS Navigation, 8 MP Camera--U.S. Version with Warranty (Blue)",Nokia,269.1,4,"Solidly built. Keyboard works nice and is the ideal thing for texting. The camera is decent once you make the necessary adjustments rather than just pointing and shooting which also works when the conditions are right. I can access my corporate network which is a plus for me, this cannot be done using an android phone at all. The HDMI port is a big advantage as it can be connected to a multimedia projector with an HDMI port and a presentation can be made. Apart from that it can also be used to connect to a monitor while a keyboard can be connected to the USB port turning the entire system into a computer system. The use of memory stick on the go is a commendable one and this attracts attention. The sound system is very clear but what sucks is that the speakers are at the back of the phone and this is one of the reasons for giving it 4 out of 5 stars. The only problem I am getting with this phone is that sometimes when I get a call and I touch the screen to accept the call nothing happens and the call is lost. This is also another reason for 4 out of 5 stars. I am sure however that future updates will solve this problem. This phone replaces my old trusted E71 and despite the problems, I am very happy overall with it. It is certainly not a toy phone but a real phone for the real man or woman as the case may be. I don't have a plan so I depend a lot on internet access at work, home and other hot spots. I used skype to make a lot of foreign calls and the money I saved (since Skype to Skype is free) has already covered the cost of this phone. As for the browser, forget the one that came with the phone and download Opera Mobile which is much faster and better.Update: After updating phone I don't lose any calls again.",2.0,4

LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,1,"Actually, I don't know whether the phone even works. I never used it. It arrived with instructions in Spanish. After two attempts over a period of five working days I was able to contact the seller, NavyBlu. They responded that the phone was intended for the Spanish market. I believe this information should have been included in the product information provided at the Amazon website. Return was authorized, but I was required to print out mailing label for return. i have no printer and do not want one (another piece of technology that usually doesn't work), so Amazon suggested I get a friend or relative to print out the label or use a library printer - in other words, i should bear the inconvenience of Amazon's failure to provide relevant information. I went to the library to print out the label and only then realized that I am required to pay postage for the return. So now I'm supposed to go to the Post Office during the Christmas rush and get this thing weighed. I may or may not bother.

As for phone calls, they're clear enough for me. I originally intended to use Straightalk but they wouldn't support this phone so I had to go with AT&T.Cons: occasionally have issues with text messaging. Example: if I'm typing a message and back out of it then come back later, the message is frozen and I have to reboot the phone.

I wasn't able to receive or send (MMS) pictures. However I think that I just needed to change some settings. I tried to get 4G using my ATT sim card but was never able to. I couldn't get 3G either. It operated on ""edge"" but perhaps that could have improved with APN changes or something but while surfing on the internet it really wasn't that much slower than my Galaxy Note. Audio is a little too low even at highest setting. Truth is the camera on the phone was so bad that I didn't spend too much time checking out many of the phone's other features. The picture quality is the worst I have seen long time. If you want a phone with a camera that you can take decent pictures with...THEN DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!!!. Actually this review can be given lower rating simply because of the camera...that's if having one thing to carry to make calls and occasionally take decent pictures is important to you...............................UPDATE.......................................................

BlackBerry Torch 9810 White WiFi Unlocked GSM QuadBand 3G Cell Phone,BlackBerry,83.72,1,"I bought this Blackberry thinking that it was 4G phone as it was advertised in the product description when I bought it and until about a week ago. The description used to say ""BLACKBERRY TORCH 9810 WHITE UNLOCKED GSM 4G WORLD PHONE WITH 3G BANDS 1,2,5&6, and now they changed it for ""BLACKBERRY TORCH 9810 WHITE WIFI UNLOCKED GSM QUADBAND 3G CELL PHONE"". I guess they changed because they realized their mistake... Still, they refuse to return my money back which I think is a FRAUD.After I got the phone and used it for less than 2 weeks, I noticed that it was even slower than my former 3G BB so I took it to my phone provider to check what was going on and they told me that the problem was that my new Blackberry was 3G not 4G as advertised. When I wrote to the seller saying that this wasn't the product I was expecting and I wanted to return it, they say:""Depending on which carrier you are using it with will determine what speed you can get and if 4g is available but I have gone ahead and authorized your return request so you can send it back to us""I was happy that at least I will get my money back. But a couple of weeks after I returned the item, they wrote me an email saying that they will only refund $169.84 for the Blackberry I returned, even though I paid $287.99!!!!! This means they are taking $118.15 from me! And they don't recognize that it was their responsibility to have advertised the product mistakenly.I have called the seller 6 times and talked to different people from the Department of Returns and Costumer Services, and they always find that ""I'm right"", but ""they don't have the 'authority' to give my money back"". The last time I called, the agent run out of arguments and told me he will transfer me to his supervisor, which it turned out to be a voice mail... unacceptable!! They always say that the person in charge will call me back and he never did.This whole process has been absolutely annoying and time-consuming, I felt absolutely cheated and nobody in the company was willing to take responsibility of their mistake (MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENT and then MY MONEY STOLEN). I would never ever will buy from this seller again. After all... I guess it is time to change to an Apple device, where they do care for the costumer satisfaction.I will also fill out a consumer complaint with the Directory of State and Local Consumer Agencies and will see what happens... I really hope that the seller will call me back, recognize their error and return the rest of my money.",5.0,0

Camera sucks as others have stated. The back feels loose after you take it off and put a sim and SD card in it which makes it feel a bit cheap. Put a case on it will take care of the problem.I'm going to stick with my trusty Nokia 520 I got for $50 last Thanksgiving. While the screen is not nearly as good as this one and lacks some apps, the new 8.1 update has given it many features that I happen to love including Wifi Sense, Mix radio (offline mixes) a way better camera, Cortana and others. Oh yeah 4g too. And now that I've had it 6 months i got it unlocked for free. Only wish the screen was as good as this one.I'm sending it back.",0.0,4

LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - White 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,399.0,4,"Great size. About the same as the Samsung Galaxy S5, but without (so far) the display problem drama. Great pure Android unlocked phone. AT&T network works fine and so does Verizon. (I have not used it with any other carriers). Note that if you are moving from a locked feature phone to a smart phone like the 5X, you will probably have to transfer your phone book by purchasing a SIM reader and then upload the address book .vcf file to Google Cloud, as I had to. Like the Kindle Fire's link to Amazon. , this phone is solidly linked to Google and works best in the Google sphere.I recommend buying this phone directly from Google as they offer an extended warranty that is not available through Amazon or other second party dealers.Why four stars? One feature we would like, the IR ""blaster"" is not included, meaning it can't be used as a multimedia remote control. We also found that the alarm app supplied by Google hung after notification with no way to turn it off except by rebooting. And there appears to be little if any water resistance. No IP-65 or IP-67 rating. Battery life till recharge notification is 1-1/4 to two days with minimal calling.",0.0,0

"Apple iPhone 6 Plus 128GB Factory Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Smartphone, Space Gray (Certified Refurbished)",,482.92,4,"Phone seems to be in very good shape. The screen is scratch free as is most of the body. It is also clean. There is one small dent in the body of the phone right next to the lightening connector, but it is small and minor. I checked the IMEI number with Apple and this phone was given to someone less than 2 months ago as a warranty replacement under Applecare. So either it was likely used minimally and is basically an Apple refurb. 90 Day warranty from the seller is what we get and that is better than buying one from eBay. So far I am pleased, though the iPhone cable that came with it appears to be a fake and ""is not supported.""By the way, shipping from BuySPRY was EXTREMELY fast. I purchased on a Saturday night and it arrived before noon on Sunday with Prime shipping.",4.0,4

Moto G Play (4th gen.) - Black - 16 GB - Unlocked,,149.0,5,"Great phone for the price! Ads don't really bother me at all but I do wish I could move the Amazon box on the second screen, but that's a nit. This is a whole different(better) experience than Android 4.4 on my previous 4.5"" Moto G(2nd gen?) from Cricket. That one seemed to be running out of memory (1GB/8GB) with programs not responding errors. Cricket never updated Android, but since this one is unlocked I will be able to get updates. I seem to have a better connection(more bars) to Cricket and the dialing program is much improved. I think the camera program is better too.For people running a Charter email account with the Gmail app., I have a major tip- set up the account with WIFI Turned OFF! With my previous Moto G, and with this one, if I was not connected to WIFI, my sent mail would often end up failed in the outbox. But now it seems to actually work.",0.0,0

Samsung Convoy U640 Phone for Verizon Wireless Network with No Contract (Gray) Rugged,Samsung,79.95,5,"This is my second Convoy phone. The first spent three years with me and was used, abused and dropped to the pavement more times than I can remember. It is not water proof. I left it outside one nite and after that, it went south. It ate the battery, got very hot and generally gave me the finger. However, it had been so good to me that I bought another used one on Amazon for a bargain price.So, this is a basic phone with some internet capabilities that I don't give a rip about. It endures drops to the pavement, has great clarity via Verizon and quite simply, works. If you don't need or don't care about watching videos or scrolling through whatever it is you scroll through to make your day (actually, make your moment), and if you need a basic phone that's rugged and not really waterproof, but water resistant, this is an inexpensive choice. Bottom line, if I lose this one, I'll find another ""old"" Convoy to replace it. Hell, I drive an eight year-old Subaru. I need rugged and practical, so why should I get a ""smart"" phone? My advice: Consider what you need, not what someone wants to sell you so you can stay ""connected.""",5.0,0

BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Silver,BLU,139.0,4,"The ONLY reason this isnt getting 5 stars is bc there are no options for a good solid case. Im coming from the blu studio 5.0 C HD (wich is a fantastic phone other than having to be charged 2+ times a day)I really wish things popped off the screen like my studio but its still really nice. It came in today and i immediately gave it a full charge. After charging i started streaming HD videos and movies for the last 10 hrs basically nonstop. Just put it back on charge with like 20% left.....and that was using WIFI which normally drains faster.Others have said it freezes/unresponsive....ive had no such issueIve read bad reviews about the speaker. Im sry but if u cant hear this thing i dont think even a hearing aid can make ur life any better.The colors are bright and vivid but theyre not to cool tone people are used to. Its a warmer look but its still niceIt almost seems to mimick an iphone the way the stock icons and launcher are set up. No app drawer just everything on homescreens. Just download your fav launcher/theme/icon pack to change this if u want. Overall im very very pleased with this phone. I WANT MORE CASE OPTIONS THOUGH, PLEASE!!!",1.0,4
